# Abstract

Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications
and DNA methylation, are important regulators of gene
expression. Variation in epigenetic modifications generates
all the different cell types in a multi-cellular organism
from the same genome. Epigenetic variation is also a 
critical component of variation in gene expression across 
genetically distinct individuals. Understanding vraiation 
in phenotypes across cell types and individuals requires 
an understanding of gene regulation. Mice are a widely 
used model of health and disease in humans, and in 
particular the diversity outbred (DO) mice and the inbred 
founders that generated this population are widely used to 
dissect the role of gene regulation in health and disease. 
Although there have been many studies linking genetic 
variation to variation in gene expression in this model,
there is little known about how epigenetic modifications 
vary in these strains. Mapping epigenetic modifications 
in this population will improve our understanding of the 
mechanisms of gene regulation in these widely used mice. 
To this end, we performed a strain survey of epigenetic 
modifications in hepatocytes of the DO founders. We also 
surveyed DBA/2J, which with C57Bl/6J is one of the founders 
of the BXD recombinant inbred strains of mice, another widely 
used population in modeling disease. We surveyed four histone 
modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K27ac), 
and DNA methylation. We used ChromHMM to identify 14 
chromatin states, each of which represented a distinct 
combination of the four histone modifications. We found 
that, in contrast to DNA methylation, chromatin state 
was strongly correlated with local gene expression across 
the inbred mice. We then imputed chromatin state and DNA 
methylation status into an independent population of 
diversity outbred (DO) mice and found that imputed chromatin 
state was more strongly correlated with variation in gene
expression than either DNA methylation status or local SNP 
genotype. We use an example to illustrate how chromatin state
can be aligned with gene expression to identify specific 
genomic regions that may mediate expression quantitative 
trait loci (eQTLs) through chromatin state variation. 
Finally, we provide a data resource that documents 
strain-specific variation in chromatin state in hepatocytes 
across nine widely used strains of laboratory mice.

# Introduction

Although different cell types in an organism house the same 
genome, each has a distinct pattern of gene expression. These
cell-type specific patterns of expression are established 
through epigenetic modification of both histones 
\citep{pmid32671792, pmid29625185} and DNA methylation 
\citep{pmid21701563, pmid20720541}, which influence the 
accessibility of DNA to transcription machinery
\citep{lawrence2016lateral, jones2012functions, moore2013dna}. 

This variation in epigenetic landscapes across cell types 
has been extensively documented \citep{pmid21441907, pmid25693563}
and has been used to richly annotate functional elements in 
both mouse \citep{stamatoyannopoulos2012encyclopedia, baker2019tissue, yue2014comparative} 
and human genomes \citep{pmid25693563, pmid23595227, pmid20657582}. 
Such functional annotations provide insight into mechanisms 
of gene regulation. Because the majority of disease-associated 
genetic variants discovered in humans are in gene regulatory 
regions, it has been suggested that it is the regulation of 
gene expression, rather than alteration of protein function, 
that is the primary mechanism through which genetic variation 
confers disease risk 
\citep{maurano2012systematic, farh2015genetic, pmid21617055, pmid19474294}.
Detailed epigenomic landscapes, therefore, may provide important
mechanistic insight linking genotype to disease risk.

Work in humans \citep{mcvicker2013identification, kang2021genetic}, 
rats \citep{rintisch2014natural}, and cattle 
\citep{prowse2022genetic} have linked genetic variation 
across individuals to variation in the histone landscape.
Such variation can alter gene regulation through the
disruption of transcription factor binding sites and 
other mechanisms \citep{mcvicker2013identification}. 
In support of this idea, genetic loci associated with 
variability in the histone landscape frequently overlap 
with expression quantitative trait loci \citep{kang2021genetic, 
rintisch2014natural, prowse2022genetic} and genetic loci 
associated with clinical outcomes \citep{kang2021genetic}.
For example, genetic variants in the promoters of CAPN1 and 
LINC00959 which were associated with variation in H3K4me3 
and H3K27ac modifications, were also associated with 
variation in expression of the locally encoded genes 
and with patient outcomes following surgery for lung 
adenocarcenoma \citet{kang2021genetic}. Similarly, studies 
have identified genetic loci that are associated both 
with variation in DNA methylation and higher level 
clinical outcomes such as immune dysregulation and 
asthma \citep{hawe2022genetic}.

This body of work demonstrates the important links 
between genetic variation, epigenetic variation, and 
higher level phenotypes. Thus, mapping variation of 
the epigenetic landscape in models of human disease 
is critical to understanding mechanisms of gene 
regulation in these models. Laboratory mice are one 
of the most widely used models of human disease, and 
yet there is little known about the landscape of 
epigenetic modifications in these animals. 

In the last decades the development of the diversity 
outbred (DO) mice \citep{Svenson:2012hq, churchill2012diversity, 
koyuncu2021cxcl1, kurtz2020diversity, bogue2015collaborative, 
kebede2014insights, keller2019gene} and their sister population, 
the collaborative cross (CC) mice \citep{threadgill2011collaborative, 
threadgill2012ten, durrant2011collaborative, mao2015identification, 
graham2021baseline}, has demonstrated the critical importance of 
genetic diversity in our understanding of disease biology.

The epigenetic landscape in these important models is still 
relatively unexplored. To address this gap in knowledge, we 
undertook a strain survey of epigenetic variation in hepatocytes 
across the eight founders of the DO/CC mice, as well as DBA/2J, 
which, along with C57BL/6J, is one of the founders of 
the widely used BxD recombinant inbred panel of mice 
\citep{Ashbrook:2019bd}. We assayed four histone 
modifications: H3K4me3, which is associated with promoter 
regions \citep{heintzman2007distinct, pmid15680324}, H3K4me1, 
which is associated with enhancer regions \citep{heintzman2007distinct},
H3K27me3, which is associated with polycomb repression \citep{bonasio2010molecular}, 
and H3K27ac, which has been associated with enhancement of active 
enhancers and promoters \citep{creyghton2010histone, heintzman2009histone, rada2011unique}.
We also assayed DNA methylation which is associated with 
variation in gene expression depending on its position
relative to the gene \citep{moore2013dna, jones2012functions}.
Methylation of DNA in promoters reduces gene expression, whereas
methylation of DNA in insulators reduces the effect of the insulator
thereby increasing expression of the targeted gene \citep{jones2012functions}.

We used ChromHMM \citep{Ernst:2012ii} to identify `r num.states` 
chromatin states, each representing a unique combination of 
the four histone marks. We investigated the association between 
variation in these states and variation in gene expression across 
the nine strains. We also investigated the relationship between 
DNA methylation and gene expression across strains.

We further investigated the relationship between epigenetic state 
and local regulation of gene expression by imputing the 
`r num.states` chromatin states and DNA methylation into a 
population of DO mice. We then mapped gene expression to the 
imputed epigenetic states to assess the extent to which expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in the DO were related to variation 
in epigenetic modifications. 

# Results

Both gene expression and epigenetic state were consistent within 
mouse strains but varied across the strains suggesting strong 
genetic regulation of both modalities. This is seen as a 
clustering of individuals from the same strain in principal 
component plots of transcriptomic and epigenetic features 
(Figure \ref{fig:pc_plots}). Patterns of gene 
expression (Figure \ref{fig:pc_plots}A), DNA methylation (Figure 
\ref{fig:pc_plots}B) and individual histone modifications (Figure 
\ref{fig:pc_plots}C-F) clustered in similar patterns although a 
relatively small percent of the variation in the methylome was
related to strain. The three subspecies \textit{musculus} (in red), 
\textit{castaneous} (in green)
and \textit{domesticus} (all others) were widely separated suggesting
that subspecies structure made up the majority of the observed variance. 
The \text{domesticus} strains largely clustered together. These data 
provide evidence that epigenetic features relate to gene expression 
in a manner that is consistent with the subspecific origin of the 
mouse strains \citep{yang2007subspecific}.

## Chromatin state overview

To investigate the association between histone modifications and 
gene expression, we used ChromHMM to identify 
`r num.states` chromatin states composed of unique combinations 
of the four histone modifications. Panel A in Figure 
\ref{fig:state_overview} shows the representation of each histone 
modification across the states. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]

\caption{Overview of chromatin state composition, genomic 
distribution, and effect on expression. (A) Emission 
probabilites for each histone modification in each

functional elements in the genome. Red indicates that the 
state is enriched near the annotated functional element. 
Blue indicates that the state is depleted near the annotated 
functional element. Abbreviations are as follows:

variation in the state on gene expression. Bars are colored 
based on the size and direction the state's effect on expression.

annotations for each state based on combining the data in 
the previous three panels. The numbers in parentheses indicate 
the percent of the genome that was assigned to each state.}
\label{fig:state_overview}
\end{figure}

The states were enriched around known and predicted functional 
elements in the mouse genome (Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}B). 
For example, the majority of the states were enriched around 
transcription start sites (TSS), and other 
TSS-related functional elements, such as promoters and CpG islands. 
Two states (States `r repressor.state` and `r nomark.state`) 
were primarily found in intergenic regions. Three states 
(States `r strong.intragenic.enhancer`, `r weak.intragenic.enhancer`, 
and `r tes.intragenic.enhancer`) were enriched around predicted enhancers, 
and one (State `r unknown.state`) was enriched predominantly near the 
transcription end sites (TES). 

We investigated whether the presence of each state was associated 
with a change in expression both across genes (within individuals), 
and across strains (See Methods). 

Most states were also associated with variation in gene expression 
(Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}C). We associated transcription with
chromatin state in two ways: across transcripts (XXX gray/tan bars), and across 
strains. To associate chromatin state with expression across transcripts,
we calculated the proportion of the gene body that was covered by each
state in each inbred strain. We then fit a linear model to associate
the proportion of each chromatin state with the amount of transcription
(Methods). We did this separately in each strain. Some chromatin states, 
such as state (XXX active enhancer) were more abundant in highly expressed 
genes, whereas other states, such as state (XXX repressor state), were more 
abundant in lowly expressed genes. The error bars show the 95\% confidence 
interval around each estimate. 

We additionally associated variance in chromatin state across strains
with variation in gene expression (XXX brighter bars). To do this, we 
normalized the expression of each transcript and the proportion of each 
chromatin state across strains (Methods). We then fit a linear model to 
estimate whether the proportion of each state varying across strains was
associated with gene expression. For any given transcript, strains with
greater proportions of state (XXX active enhancer) had greater expression
than strains with lower proportions of state (XXX active enhancer).

In Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}C, the states are ordered by their
association with gene expression when varying across strains, which 
helps illustrate several patterns. Overall, states that were associated 
with increased expression across transcripts were also associated with 
increased expression when varying across strains. The state with the 
largest negative association with gene expression, State `r nomark.state`, 
is the absence of all measured modifications. Other states associated 
with reduced gene expression contained the repressive mark H3K27me3. 
The states with the largest positive effects on expression all had some 
combination of the activating marks, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac. 
The repressive mark was less commonly seen in these activating states. 
These global patterns of positional enrichment and association with 
expression largely agree with previous findings.

By merging the information from Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}A-C, we 
were able to suggest annotations for many of the `r num.states` chromatin 
states (Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}D). States with the strongest 
effects on expression had the clearest annotations, while states with 
weaker effects remained unannotated. 

## DNA methylation overview

To investigate the variation in DNA methylation across the
the inbred strains, we examined both strain-specific CpG 
sites and strain-specific methylation values. We defined a 
strain-specific CpG site as one that was present in all 
individuals in at least one strain and absent in all 
individuals in at least one other strain (Methods).

Across all chromosomes between 16% and 19% of CpG sites were
strain-specific (Supplemental Figure XXX). Strain-specific
CpG sites were more commonly present in CAST, PWK, and B6
compared to the other strains (Spplemental Figure XXX).

We used CpG sites in B6 animals as a reference and looked
for enrichment around genomic features such as CpG islands,
enhances, and transcription start sites (Methods). In B6 animals,
CpG sites were most enriched in CpG islands and promoters, as 
expected, and were depleted around the transcription end site
(Supplemental Figure XXX). Relative to B6 sites, strain-specific 
CpG sites were more enriched in enhancers, and less enriched in 
all other features (Supplemental Figure XXX).

## Spatial distribution of epigenetic modifications around gene bodies

In addition to looking for enrichment of chromatin states near 
annotated functional elements, we characterized the fine-grained 
spatial distribution of each state around gene bodies by normalizing
gene position to run from 0 at the TSS to 1 at the TES (See Methods) 
(Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}A-B). We similarly 
characterized the distribution of CpG sites and their percent 
methylation at this gene-level scale (Figure 
\ref{fig:state_abundance}C-D). 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics[width=0.67\textwidth]{Figures/Fig3_Abundance.png} 
\caption{Relative abundance of chromatin states and methylated DNA. (A) Each panel 
shows the abundance of a single chromatin state relative to gene TSS and TES. The 
$y$-axis in each panel is the proportion of genes containing the state. Each
panel has an independent $y$-axis to better show the shape of each curve.
The $x$-axis is the relative gene position. The TSS and TES are marked as vertical
gray dashed lines. (B) The same data shown in panel A, but with all states overlayed
onto a single set of axes to show the relative abundance of the states. 
(C) The density of CpG sites relative to the gene body. The $y$-axis shows the 
number of CpG sites per base pair. The density is highest near the TSS. 
CpG sites are less dense within the gene body and in the intergenic space. 
(D) Percent methylation relative to the gene body. The $y$-axis shows the median 
percent methylation at CpG sites, and the $x$-axis shows relative gene position. 
CpG sites near the TSS are unmethylated relative to intragenic sites and to sites
just upstream and downstream of the gene bodies. In both C and D standard error 
is shown as a blue envelope around the mean; however, the standard error is so 
small that it is not visible in the figure.}
\label{fig:state_abundance}
\end{figure}

The spatial patterns of the individual chromatin states are shown 
in (Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}A), and an overlay of all 
states together (Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}B) emphasizes the
difference in abundance between the most abundant states (States 
`r active.enhancer.state`, `r active.promoter.state`, and 
`r nomark.state`), and the remaining states, which were 
relatively rare.

Each chromatin state had a characteristic distribution pattern
across the gene body. For example, State `r nomark.state`, 
which was characterized by the absence of all measured histone 
modifications, was strongly depleted near the TSS, indicating 
that this region is commonly subject to the histone modifications 
we measured here. It should be noted this this pattern is independent
of the global enrichment patterns shown in Figure (XXX). Although
state `r nomark.state` is generally depleted in gene bodies relative
to intergenic regions, it is especially depleted at the TSS.
In contrast, States `r active.enhancer.state` and `r active.promoter.state` 
were both enriched at the TSS. State `r active.promoter.state` 
was very narrowly concentrated right at the TSS, whereas State 
`r active.enhancer.state` was more broadly abundant both upstream 
and downstream of the TSS. Both were associated overall with 
increased expression across inbred mice (indicated by red shading
in Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}), 
suggesting promoter or enhancer functions. The third state in this 
group of expression-enhancing states, State 
`r strong.intragenic.enhancer`, was depleted nere the TSS, but 
enriched within the gene body, suggesting that this state may 
mark enhancers.

States with weaker associations to expression (indicated by grayer shades
in Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance})
were of lower abundance, but had distinct distribution patterns 
around the gene body suggesting the possibility of distinct 
functional roles in the regulation of gene expression. The
abundance patterns were identical across all strains 
(Supplemental Figure XXX)

DNA methylation showed similarly characteristic variation in abundance
(Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}C-D). The TSS had densely packed 
CpG sites relative to the gene body (Figure 
\ref{fig:state_abundance}C). As expected, the median CpG site near 
the TSS was consistently hypomethylated relative to the median CpG 
site in intra- and intergenic regions (Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}D).
All genes used in this analysis were expressed and thus had some 
degree of hypomethylation.

## Spatially resolved effects on gene expression

The distinct spatial distributions of the chromatin states and 
methylated CpG sites around the gene body raised the question 
as to whether the effects of these states on gene expression 
could also be spatially resolved. To investigate this possibility 
we tested the association between gene expression and both 
chromatin state and DNA methylation using spatially resolved models
(Methods). We tested the effect of each chromatin state on 
expression across genes within hepatocytes (Figure 
\ref{fig:state_effects}A) and the effect of each chromatin state 
on the variation in gene expression across strains (Figure 
\ref{fig:state_effects}B).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/Fig4_Effects.png}
\caption{Effects of chromatin states on gene expression. Each column shows 
the effect of the chromatin states on gene expression in a different 
experimental context. The first column shows that the presence of some
states is correlated with higher abundance genes while the presence of
other states is correlated with lower abundance genes in mouse hepatocytes. 
The second column shows that variation in chromatin state across strains
is correlated with variation in gene expression. The third column 
shows the effect of imputed chromatin state on gene expression in a 
population of DO mice. The $y$-axis in each column is constant for comparison
of states to each other within a single context. The $y$-axes vary across
columns to highlight the similarity of the shape of each curve across 
settings. The final column shows the annotation of each state. All $y$-axes 
show the $\beta$ coefficient from the linear model shown in equation 1 (Methods). 
All $x$-axes show the relative position along the gene body. Vertical gray 
dashed lines mark the TSS and TES. Each colored region signifies the 95\% 
confidence interval around the mean estimate.}
\label{fig:state_effects}
\end{figure}

All chromatin states demonstrated spatially dependent effects 
on gene expression within hepatocytes. For many of the states, 
the effects on expression were concentrated at or near the TSS, 
while in the other states effects were seen across the whole gene. 
The direction of the effects matched the overall effects of each 
state seen previously (Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}). The spatial 
effects were recapitulated for almost every state when 
we measured across strains. That is, chromatin states that either
enhanced or suppressed gene expression across hepatocyte genes
were similarly related to variation in expression across strains.
This suggests that the genetic differences between strains modify
chromatin activity in a manner similar to that used across genes.
One notable exception was State `r weak.intragenic.enhancer`, whose 
presence upregulated genes within hepatocytes, but did not contribute
to expression variation across strains.

We also examined the effect of percent DNA methylation across genes 
within hepatocytes and across strains (Figure 
\ref{fig:DNA_methylation_effect}). As expected, methylation at 
the TSS was associated with lower expressed genes in hepatocytes
(Figure \ref{fig:DNA_methylation_effect}A). 
We did not detect an association between DNA methylation percent
and gene expression across inbred strains, perhaps because there
were too few strains to reliabley estimate the effects 
((Figure \ref{fig:DNA_methylation_effect}B)). However,
we did see a significant negative association between DNA 
methylation and gene expression when we imputed DNA methylation 
in the DO (Figure \ref{fig:DNA_methylation_effect}C). 
These results suggest that heritably DNA methylation contributes
significantly to eQTL in genetically diverse individuals.

transcription start site (TSS) to the transcription end site (TES), 
marked with vertical gray dashed lines. The horizontal solid black 
line indicates an effect of 0. The shaded gray area shows 95\% 
confidence interval arond the model fit.}

\end{figure}


## Interactions betweeh chromatin state and DNA methylation

We investigated whether there was an interaction between DNA
methylation and chromatin state by asking two questions. First,
were CpG sites within different chromatin states methylated at
different levels? And second, was DNA methylation within specific
chromatin states differentially associated with gene 
expression across inbred mice? If DNA methylation essentially
inactivates a region of DNA, methylation in a region identified
as a repressor based on its chromatin state might be expected 
to increase gene expression, whereas methylation in an active 
enhancer might decrease gene expression. 

To investigate these questions, we identified CpG sites within each
of the `r num.states` chromatin states. We calculated the average 
percent methylation of these sites, and the effect of DNA methylation
on gene expression for each set of sites (Methods). We treated missing 
CpG sites in individual strains as non-methylated.

There were differential levels of DNA methylation as seen in Figure XXX.
Although methylation patterns in all states followed roughly the same
pattern of unmethylated at the transcription start site and methylated
within the gene body, values ranged widely across the states from State
`r active.promoter.state` with a mean of 27\% methylated DNA intragenically,
to State `r nomark.state` with 83\% methylated DNA intragenically.


## Imputed chromatin state explained expression variation in diversity outbred mice

Thus far, we have used inbred strains of mice to identify correlations 
between local chromatin state and gene expression. We were also interested
in whether chromatin state and DNA methylation were associated with
gene expression in an outbred mouse population. Although we did not 
measure epigenetic modifications directly in an outbred population,
we had liver gene expression from a previously published population 
of diversity outbred mice \citep{pmid28592500}. Inheritance of chromatin
state and DNA methylation is complex \citep{rintisch2014natural}; 
however there is evidence that the heritability for both epigenetic 
features is high \citep{pmid16009939; pmid33931130} suggesting the 
possibility of imputing epigenetic features from local genotype into
the to mice. Even with imperfect of epigenetic features estimates in 
the outbred mice, a common pattern of association between outbred and
inbred mice would imply that inherited variance in epigenetic features
contributes to inherited variation in gene expression across individuals.

We imputed chromatin state and DNA methylation into the DO population
(Methods). We then looked for associations between these imputed 
epigenetic features and DO gene expression.

mapped 
gene expression to the imputed features and calculated the variance 
explained (Methods). The overall distributions of variance explained 
by each feature across all transcripts are shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:effect_distrubutions}. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Fig6_Imputation.png} 
\caption{Gene expression variance in a DO population explained 
by chromatin state compared to three other genomic features: 
local haplotype, local SNP genotype, and local imputed DNA 
methylation status. A. Distributions of gene expression variance 
explained by each feature. B. Direct comparisons of 
variance explained by local haplotype, and each of the other 
genomic features. Blue lines show $y = x$. Each point is a 
single transcript.}
\label{fig:effect_distrubutions}
\end{figure}

These distributions show the haplotype effect for the marker nearest each 
transcript compared with the maximum effect across the gene body for 
each of the other imputed features. Overall, local haplotype explained 
the largest amount of variance of gene expression in the DO 
($R^2 = `r mean.var.exp["Haplotype_R2"]`$; 99\% 
CI = `r paste(var.ci["Haplotype_R2",], collapse = "-")`). 
The variance explained by local chromatin state was very highly 
correlated with that of haplotype 
(Pearson $r = `r var.exp.cor["Haplotype_R2", "Chromatin_R2"]`$, 99\% 
CI = `r paste(r.ci[intersect(which(comp.pairs[,1] == "Haplotype_R2"), which(comp.pairs[,2] == "Chromatin_R2")),], collapse = "-")`) 
and explained almost as much variance in gene expression 
in the DO as local haplotype ($R^2 = `r mean.var.exp["Chromatin_R2"]`$, 
99% CI = `r paste(var.ci["Chromatin_R2",], collapse = "-")`). The mean 
variance explained by SNPs was lower ($R^2 = `r mean.var.exp["SNP_R2"]`$; 99\% 
CI = `r paste(var.ci["SNP_R2",], collapse = "-")`) 
than that explained by haplotype and was not as highly correlated with 
local haplotype as chromatin state was 
(Pearson $r = `r var.exp.cor["Haplotype_R2", "SNP_R2"]`$; 99\% 
CI = `r paste(r.ci[intersect(which(comp.pairs[,1] == "Haplotype_R2"), which(comp.pairs[,2] == "SNP_R2")),], collapse = "-")`). 
DNA methylation, the lower bound for variance explained by a feature imputed 
from local haplotype, explained the lowest amount of expression variance in 
the DO population ($R^2 = `r mean.var.exp["Methylation_R2"]`$; 99\% 
CI = `r paste(var.ci["Methylation_R2",], collapse = "-")`), 
and had a much lower correlation to haplotype than either chromatin state 
or SNPs (Pearson $r = `r var.exp.cor["Haplotype_R2", "Methylation_R2"]`$; 
99\% CI = `r paste(r.ci[intersect(which(comp.pairs[,1] == "Haplotype_R2"), which(comp.pairs[,2] == "Methylation_R2")),], collapse = "-")`). Taken 
together, these results suggest that the majority of haplotype-associated 
variance is encoded by the chromatin state of the allele. Moreover, this 
encoding is primarily local and present in the relevant inbred founder strain.

To investigate whether natural variation in chromatin state can be used
to identify cis regulatory regions the mouse genome, we looked at the 
relationship between chromatin state and gene expression in individual 
genes. An example gene, \textit{Pkd2}, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}. This figure
shows chromatin state (Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}B), SNP genotype 
(Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}C), and DNA methylation 
(Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}D) status along the gene body of 
\textit{Pkd2}. It also shows the association of each of these
features with gene expression calculated across the whole gene body
(Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}A).

The detailed view of this gene identifies two particularly interesting
regions. One is at the TSS and the immediately surrounding area, and 
the other is just downstream of the TSS. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/Fig7_Example.png} 
\caption{Example of epigenetic states and imputation results for a single

\label{fig:example_gene}
\end{figure}

These two regions were both strongly associated expression levels 
(Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}A). Those strains with activating
histone states in these regions had much higher expression
of \textit{Pkd2} than the two strains that did not have activating
states in this region. We hypothesize that these two regions are
enhancers.

The spatial patterns in the SNPs only partially mirror those in chromatin 
state (Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}C). SNPs underlying the putative 
enhancer region at the TSS could potentially influence gene expression by 
altering local chromatin state. However, the more downstream enhancer has 
no underlying SNPs, suggesting that there is an alternative mechanism for 
determining chromatin state at this location. Perhaps SNPs in the TSS region
regulate both enhancers.

Percent DNA methylation does not vary across the strains in either of these 
putative enhancer regions, and does not contribute to variation in expression 
across genetically distinct individuals (Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}D). 


# Discussion

In this study we showed that genetic variation across inbred
mice alters histone modification patterns in hepatocytes. We 
further showed that the variation in histone patterns was 
highly related to variation in gene expression across strains. 
These observations suggest that within a cell type specific 
patterns of histone modifications are determined by local 
genotype, and are likely a major mechanism through which 
eQTL are generated. This hypothesis was 
supported by the high concordance between chromatin state, 
which was imputed from local genotype, and gene expression
in an independent outbred population of mice. Thus, across 
cell types, there is likely a strong interaction between factors 
determining cell fate, such as transcription factor expression, 
and local genetics. 

In contrast to chromatin state, percent DNA methylation was not 
associated with variation in gene expression across inbred 
strains or in the outbred population. At the TSS, this was 
largely due to a lack of variation in methylation across strains. 
An example of this observation is shown in panel D of Figure 
\ref{fig:example_gene}. Despite strain variation in both genotype 
and chromatin state at the TSS of \textit{Pkd2}, DNA methylation 
was invariant -- the CpG island at the TSS is unmethylated in all 
strains. Thus, although chromatin state appears to be highly 
influenced by local haplotype, percent DNA methylation is not.
CpG islands are highly conserved across vertebrates \citep{papin2021cpg}
and may thus be regions of low genetic variation within this study 
relative to the surrounding regions in which SNPs and variations
in histone modifications are abundant.

Variation in DNA methylation has shown a similar lack of association
with gene expression in humans \citep{pmid33931130}. Multiple twin studies 
have estimated the average heritability of individual CpG sites to be 
roughly 0.19 \citep{pmid27051996, pmid24183450, pmid22532803}, with only 
about 10\% of CpG sites having a heritability greater than 0.5 
\citep{pmid24183450, pmid22532803, pmid24887635}. Trimodal CpG sites, 
i.e. those with methylation percent varying among 0, 50, and 100\%, 
have been shown in human brain tissue to be more heritable than 
unimodal, or bimodal sites ($h^2 = 0.8 \pm 0.18$), and roughly half 
were associated with local eQTL \citep{pmid20485568}. Here, we did not 
see an association between trimodal CpG sites and gene expression 
across strains (Supplemental Figure \ref{supp_fig:trimodal}).

The diversity in the effects observed in the `r num.states` chromatin 
states highlights the importance of analyzing combinatorial states as 
opposed to individual histone modifications. To illustrate this point, 
consider the three states with the largest positive effects on 
transcription. Each of these three states had a distinct combination 
of the three activatin histone marks: H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac. 
And although all three states were associated with increased gene 
expression, each had a distinct spatial distribution. This variation 
in spatial distribution was mirrored in the spatial effects on 
transcription. These distinct patterns would not be detectable 
without analysis of the histone modifications in combination. 
These results highlight the complexity of the histone code 
and the importance at analyzing combinatorial states.

While we were able to annotate several states, particularly those
with the strongest effects on gene expression, other states were 
more difficult to annotate. This raises the intruiguing possibility 
of identifying new modes of expression regulation through histone 
modification. One of these unannotated states, State `r unknown.state`, 
had a weak, but consistent negative effect on gene transcription centered 
within the gene body downstream of the TSS. This state was characterized 
by high levels of H3K4me3 and low levels of the other three modifications. 

The modification H3K4me3 is most frequently associated with increased 
transcriptional activity 
\citep{pmid15680324, pmid14661024, pmid12353038, pmid16728976}, so the 
association with state 
`r unknown.state` with reduced transcription is a deviation from the 
dominant paradigm. The physical distribution of this state is also
interesting. It was depleted at the TSS, but enriched just upstream 
and just downstream of the TSS. It was also enriched just downstream 
of the TES, although it did not appear to influence transcription at 
this location. The group of genes marked by State `r unknown.state` 
were enriched for functions such as stress response, DNA damage repair, 
and ncRNA processing suggesting that this state may be used to regulate 
subsets of genes involved in responses to environmental stimuli.

We detected two bivalent states in this survey. Bivalent states are 
characterized by a combination of activating and repressing histone 
modifications, and are usually associated with undifferentiated cells 
\citep{pmid23788621, pmid22513113}. Here we identified two bivalent 
states in adult mouse hepatocytes, and annotated them as a poised 
enhancer (State `r poised.enhancer.state`) and a bivalent 
promoter (State `r bivalent.promoter.state`). Both states were 
associated with downregulation across inbred strains when present 
near the TSS; however this effect was not replicated in the outbred 
mice. The lack of replication may be because the effect was too 
weak to detect given the number of animals in the population. 

Both bivalent promoters and poised enhancers are dynamic states that 
change over the course of differentiation and in response to external 
stimuli. Bivalent promoters have been studied primarily in 
the context of development. They are abundant in undifferentiated cells, 
and are typically resolved either to active promoters or to silenced 
promoters as the cells differentiate into their final state 
\citep{pmid23788621, pmid22513113}. These promoters have also been shown 
to be important in the response to changes in the environment. Their 
abundance increases in breast cancer cells in response to hypoxia 
\citep{pmid27800026}. Poised enhancers are also observed during differentiation 
and in differentiated cells \citep{pmid32432110}. In concordance with these 
previous observations, the genes marked by States `r bivalent.promoter.state` 
and `r poised.enhancer.state` were enriched for vascular development 
and morphogenesis. That we identified these states in differentiated 
hepatocytes may indicate that a subset of developmental genes retain 
the ability to be activated under certain circumstances, such as during 
liver regeneration in response to damage. It is also possible these 
states were induced in the inbred strains in respose to stress, rather 
than genetically coded. This could also explain why the negative effect 
on gene expression was not replicated in the outbred mice. However, given 
that we detected this state in all nine inbred strains in relatively 
equal proportions, this latter hypothesis seems less likely. 

The variation of chromatin state across strains, and its 
correspondence with expression variation offers a unique
way to identify gene regulatory regions. Genetic variation
serves as a natural perturbation to the regulatory regions,
and resulting differences in regulatory annotations can 
then be linked to variation in gene expression. The 
\textit{Pkd2} example illustrates how genetic and epigenetic
variation can be combined to identify two putative enhancer
regions for the gene. Given that there is an eQTL at this locus,
and that the inbred gene expression largely matches that of the
haplotype effects in the outbred population, the two regions
in which there is a high correlation between chromatin state
and outbred gene expression are good candidates for cis-regulatory 
elements. The variation in chromatin state further suggests a 
putative mechanism for the observation of a cis-eQTL at the 
level of the haplotype. That is that the PWK and WSB haplotypes 
lack the enhancer elements seen in the other six haplotypes.
And further, that the broader the enhancer states are, the 
more highly \textit{Pkd2} is expressed.

The discordance between the patterns of chromatin state and 
SNPs in this gene is particularly interesting. Variation in 
chromatin state at the intragenic enhancer is present in the 
absence of local SNPs. This suggests that the presence of the 
downstream enhancer is determined by another mechanism, perhaps 
SNPs acting in *trans* to this region, or local variation, such 
as indels, that was not measured by SNP genotyping. Genetic 
variation located at a distance from the putative enhancer sites
could also potentially alter the 3D configuration of the genome
resulting in variable access of transcription factors to the 
enhancer. 

Broadly, local variation in chromatin state was highly correlated with
variation in gene expression across individuals, an observation that
was replicated in an independent population of genetically diverse, 
outbred mice. The percent variance explained by chromatin state closely
matched that of haplotype, and exceeded that of individual SNPs. These
results suggest two things: First, a large portion of the effect of 
local haplotype on gene expression in mice may be mediated through 
variation in chromatin state. Second, the intermediate resolution of 
chromatin state between that of individual SNPs and broad haplotypes 
carries important infornation that cannot be resolved at the other
levels. Individual SNPs, although, sometimes causally linked to 
trait variation, are highly redundant and cannot be readily used to 
annotate functional elements in the genome. Haplotypes aggregate genomic
information over broad regions and are a powerful tool to link genomic
variation to trait variation. However, they are usually too broad to 
be used to annotate regions less than a few megabases in length. By 
combining the mapping power of haplotypes, the high resolution of SNPs, 
and the intermediate resolution of chromatin states, we can begin to 
build mechanistic hypotheses that link genetic variation to variation 
in gene expression and physiology. Understanding the role that genetic 
variation plays in modifying the chromatin state landscape will be 
critical in making these links. Through this survey we are providing 
a rigorous resource that explores the connection between genetic 
variation and epigenetic variation. Researchers in the wider 
community can query the epigenetic landscape of the nine DO/CC
inbred founders to identify candidate regulatory regions in genes
of interest and generate mechanistic hypotheses linking genetic 
variation to gene expression.

# Materials and Methods

## Ethics Statement

All animal procedures followed Association for Assessment and Accreditation of 
Laboratory Animal Care guidelines and were approved by Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee (The Jackson Laboratory, Protocol AUS #04008).

## Inbred Mice

Three female mice from each of nine inbred strains were used.
Eight of these strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ,
NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) are the eight 
strains that served as founders of the Collaborative 
Cross/Diversity Outbred mice \citep{Chesler:2008ge}. The ninth strain, DBA/2J, 
will facilitate the interpretation of existing and forthcoming 
genetic mapping data obtained from the BxD recombinant inbred 
strain panel. Samples were harvested from the mice at 12 
weeks of age.

### Liver perfusion

To purify hepatocytes from the liver cell population, the mouse livers 
were perfused with 87 CDU/mL Liberase collagenase with 0.02\% CaCl2 in 
Leffert's buffer to digest the liver into a single-cell suspension, 
and then isolated using centrifugation. 

We aliquoted $5 \times 10^{6}$ cells for each RNA-Seq and bisulfite sequencing, 
and the rest were cross-linked for ChIP assays. Both aliquots were spun down
at 200 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in $1200\mu L$ RTL+BME (for RNA-Seq) 
or frozen as a cell pellet in liquid nitrogen (for bisulfite sequencing). 
In the sample for ChIP-Seq, protein complexes were cross-linked to DNA
using 37\% formaldehyde in methanol. All cell samples were stored at -80°C 
until used (See Supplemental Methods for more detail). 

### Hepatocyte histone binding and gene expression assays
 
Hepatocyte samples were used in the following assays:
 
1. RNA-seq to quantify mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression, with 
  approximately 30 million reads per sample. 
2. Reduced-representation bisulfate sequencing to identify methylation 
  states of approximately two million CpG sites in the genome. The average 
  read depth was 20-30x. 
4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing to assess binding of the 
  following histone marks: 
    a. H3K4me3 to map active promoters 
    b. H3K4me1 to identify active and poised enhancers 
    c. H3K27me3 to identify closed chromatin
    d. H3K27ac, to identify actively used enhancers 
    e. A negative control (input chromatin) 

Samples were sequenced with $\sim40$ million reads per sample.

The samples for RNA-Seq in RTL+BME buffer were sent to The Jackson Laboratory 
Gene Expression Service for RNA extraction and library synthesis.

### Histone chromatin immunoprecipitation assays

After extraction, hepatocyte cells were lysed to release the nuclei,
spun down, and resuspended in 130ul MNase buffer with 1mM PMSF (Sigma, #78830)
and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) to prevent histone protein degradation. 
The samples were then digested with 15U of micrococcal nuclease (MNase), 
which digests the exposed DNA, but leaves the nucleosome-bound DNA intact.
We confirmed digestion of nucleosomes into 150bp fragments with 
agarose gel. The digestion reaction was stopped with EDTA and samples 
were used immediately in the ChIP assay. The ChIP assay was performed with
Dynabead Protein G beads and histone antibodies (H3K4me3: Millipore #07-473,
H3K4me1: Millipore #07-436, H3K27me3: Millipore #07-449, H4K27ac: abcam ab4729). 
After binding to antibodies, samples were washed to remove unbound chromatin 
and then eluted with high-salt buffer and proteinase K to digest protein away 
from DNA-protein complexes. The DNA was purified using the Qiagen PCR 
purification kit. Quantification was performed using the Qubit quantification 
system (See Supplemental Methods).

## Diversity Outbred mice
We used previously published data from a population of 478 diversity outbred 
(DO) mice \citep{Svenson:2012hq}. DO mice (JAX:DO) are available from The 
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) (stock number 009376).
The DO population included males and females from DO generations four 
through 11. Mice were randomly assigned to either a chow diet (6% fat by 
weight, LabDiet 5K52, LabDiet, Scott Distributing, Hudson, NH), or a high-fat, 
high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet (45\% fat, 40\% carbohydrates, and 15\% protein) 
(Envigo Teklad TD.08811, Envigo, Madison, WI). Mice were maintained on this 
diet for 26 weeks. 

### Genotyping
All DO mice were genotyped as described in Svenson \textit{et al.} (2012)
\citep{Svenson:2012hq} using the Mouse Universal Genotyping Array 
(MUGA) (7854 markers), and the MegaMUGA (77,642 markers) 
(GeneSeek, Lincoln, NE). All animal procedures were approved by the 
Animal Care and Use Committee at The Jackson Laboratory (Animal Use 
Summary \# 06006).

Founder haplotypes were inferred from SNPs using a Hidden Markov Model 
as described in Gattie \textit{et al.} (2014) \citep{Gatti:2014ko}. 
The MUGA and MegaMUGA arrays were merged to create a final set of 
evenly spaced 64,000 interpolated markers. 

### Tissue collection and gene expression
At euthenasia, whole livers were collected and gene expression was
measured using RNA-Seq as described perviously \citep{pmid27309819, pmid28592500}. 
Briefly, hepatocyte RNA was isolated using the Trizol Plus 
RNA extraction kit (Life Technologies), and 100-bp single-end reads 
were generated on the Illumina HiSeq 2000.


## Data Processing

### Sequence processing

The raw sequencing data from both RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq were put through 
the quality control program FastQC (0.11.5), and duplicate sequences 
were removed before downstream analysis. 

### Transcript quantification
Transcript sequences were aligned to strain-specific 
pseudo-genomes \citep{pmid27309819}, which integrate SNPs and 
indels from each strain based on the GRCm38 mouse genome 
build. The B6 samples were aligned directly to the reference 
mouse genome. The pseudogenomes were created using g2gtools 
(http://churchill-lab.github.io/g2gtools/#overview). 
We used EMASE (https://github.com/churchill-lab/emase) 
\citep{pmid29444201} to quantify the gene expression counts 
and DESeq2 vst transformation \citep{love2014moderated} to 
normalize the gene expression data. We filtered out transcripts 
with less than 1 CPM in two or more replicates.

### ChIP-Seq quantification
We used MACS 1.4.2 \citep{pmid18798982} to identify peaks in the ChIP-Seq 
sequencing data, with a significance threshold of $p \leq 10^{-5}$. 
In order to compare peaks across strains, we converted the MACS output 
peak coordinates to common B6 coordinates using g2g tools 
(https://churchill-lab.github.io/g2gtools/). 

## Quantifying DNA methylation
RRBS data were processed using a bismark-based pipeline modified from 
\citep{pmid30348905}. The pipeline uses Trim Galore! 0.6.3 
(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) for QC, 
followed by the trimRRBSdiversityAdaptCustomers.py script from NuGen for 
trimming the diversity adapters. This script is available at: 
https://github.com/nugentechnologies/NuMetRRBS

All samples had comparable quality levels and no outstanding flags. 
Total number of reads was 45-90 million, with an average read length 
of about 50 bp. Quality scores were mostly above 30 (including error bars), 
with the average above 38. Duplication level was reduced to $<2$ for about 
95\% of the sequences. 

High quality reads were aligned to a custom strain pseudogenomes, using 
bowtie2 as implemented in Bismark 0.22 \citep{pmid21493656}. The pseudogenomes were
created by incorporating strain-specific SNPs and indels into the reference 
genome using g2gtools (https://github.com/churchill-lab/g2gtools), allowing 
a more precise characterization of methylation patterns. Bismark methylation 
extractor tool was then used for creating a bed file of estimated methylation 
proportions for each animal, which was then translated to the reference mouse 
genome (GRCm38) coordinates using g2gtools. Unlike other liftover tools, 
g2gtools does not throw away alignments that land on indel regions. B6 samples 
were aligned directly to the reference mouse genome (mm10).

## Analysis of histone modifications

### Identification of chromatin states
We used ChromHMM (1.22) \citep{pmid29120462} to identify 
chromatin states, which are unique combinations of the four 
chromatin modifications, for example, one state could consist 
of high levels of both H3K4me3 and H3K4me1, and low levels 
of the other two modifications. We conducted all subsequent 
analyses at the level of the chromatin state. 

Prior to running ChromHMM, we converted the bam files that had
been aligned to the B6 genome as described above to bed files
using the bedtools function bamtobed \citep{quinlan2010bedtools}.
We then binarized the bed files using the BinarizeBed function
in ChromHMM with default parameters. 

We calculated chromatin states for all numbers of states between 
four and 16, which is the maximum number of states possible with four 
binary chromatin modifications ($2^n$). We ran all mouse strains
together in the same model as if they were different cell types
in a standard run of ChromHMM.

To ensure we were analyzing the most biologically meaningful chromatin 
states, we aligned states across all models of four to 16 states 
by assigning each to one of the sixteen possible binary states using an 
emissions probability of 0.3 as the threshold for presence/absence of the
histone mark. This threshold was used for comparison purposes only, and 
produced the most stable state estimates between models. We then 
investigated the stability of three features across all states: the 
emissions probabilities (Supp Fig1), the abundance of each 
state across transcribed genes (Supp Fig2), and the effect of each state 
on transcription (Supp Fig3). Methods for each of these analyses are 
described separately below. All measures were remarkably consistent across
all models, but the `r num.states`-state model was characterized by a wide
range of relatively abundant states with relatively strong effects on 
expression. We used this model for all subsequent analyses. For more 
details on how the different models were compared, see Supplemental Methods.

### Genome distribution of chromatin states

We investigated genomic distributions of chromatin states in two ways.
First, we used the ChromHMM function OverlapEnrichment to calculate 
enrichment of each state around known functional elements in the mouse 
genome. We analyzed the following features:

* Transcription start sites (TSS) - Annotations of TSS in the mouse genome
were provided by RefSeq \citep{pmid26553804} and included with the release of ChromHMM, 
which we downloaded on December 9, 2019 \citep{pmid29120462}.
* Transcription end sites (TES) - Annotations of TES in the mouse genome
were provided by RefSeq and included with the release of ChromHMM.
* Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) - We downloaded TFBS coordinates

In addition to these enrichments around individual elements, we also calculated 
chromatin state abundance relative to the main anatomical features of a gene.
For each transcribed gene, we normalized the base pair positions to the length
of the gene such that the transcription start site (TSS) was fixed at 0, and the
transcription end site (TES) was fixed at 1. We also included 1000 bp upstream of 
the TSS and 1000 bp downstream of the TES, which were converted to values below 0 
and above 1 respectively. To map chromatin states to the normalized positions, 
we binned the normalized positions into bins of relative position incremented
by 0.1 and encompassing all upstream and downstream positions originally defined
as 1kb up and downstream of the gene body. If a bin encompassed multiple positions 
in the gene, we assigned the mean value of the feature of interest to the bin. To 
avoid potential contamination from regulatory regions of nearby genes, we only 
included genes that were at least 2kb from their nearest neighbor, for a final 
set of 14,048 genes.

### Chromatin state and gene expression

We calculated the effect of each chromatin state on gene expression. 
We did this both across genes and across strains. The across-gene 
analysis identified states that are associated with high expression 
and low expression within the hepatocytes and independent of strain. 
The across-strain analysis investigated whether variation in chromatin 
state across strains contributed to variation in gene expression 
across strains. 

For each transcribed gene, we calculated the proportion of the gene 
body that was assigned to each chromatin state. We then fit a linear 
model separately for each state to calculate the effect of state proportion 
with gene expression:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:model}
y_{e} = \beta x_{s} + \epsilon
\end{equation}

where $y_{e}$ is the rank normal scores \citep{conover1999practical} of the full 
transcriptome in a single inbred strain, and $x_{s}$ is the rank normal
proportion of each gene that was assigned to state $s$. We fit this model 
for each strain and each state to yield one $\beta$ coefficient with a 95\% 
confidence interval. We fit the strains independently to better identify
variation in chromatin state effects across strains. However, the effects 
were not different across strains (ANOVA $p > 0.5$), so we averaged the 
effects and confidence intervals across strains to yield one summary effect 
for each state. We further fit models for each state independently, rather
than a multiple regression, because we were primarily interested in the
marginal effects of each state for this study.

To calculate the effect of each chromatin state across strains, we first 
standardized transcript abundance across strains for each transcript. We 
also standardized the proportion of each chromatin state for each gene 
across strains. We then fit the same linear model, where $y_{e}$ was a 
rank normal vector concatenating all standardized expression levels 
across all strains, and $x_{s}$ was a rank normal vector concatenating 
all standardized state proportions across all strains. We fit the model for 
each state independently yielding a $\beta$ coefficient and 95\% confidence 
interval for each state. 

In addition to calculating the effect of state proportion across the full gene
body, we also performed the same calculations in a position-based manner. This
second analysis yielded an effect of each state at multiple points along the 
gene body and a more nuanced view of the effect of each state.

## Analysis of DNA methylation

### Creation of DNA methylome
We combined the DNA methylation data into a single methylome cataloging
all unique methylated sites across all strains. For each site, we averaged 
the percent methylation across the three replicates in each strain. The final
methylome contained 5,311,670 unique sites across the genome. Because 
methylated CpG sites can be fully methylated, unmethylated, or 
hemi-methylated, we rounded the average percent methylation at each site 
to the nearest 0, 50, or 100\%.

### Decomposition of DNA methylome
To calculate the DNA methylation similarity across individuals 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:pc_plots}B we used the subset of the 
CpG sites that were shared across all strains at each B6 reference 
position. The resulting matrix contained individual mice in columns 
and shared methylation sites in rows. Each cell contained the measured 
level of DNA methylation at that position. We performed principle 
components analysis on this matrix.

### Strain-specific CpG sites
In addition to the analysis of CpG sites that were shared across
genes, we analyzed CpG sites that were strain-specific. We defined
a strain-specific CpG site as one that was present in all members
of at least one strain and absent in all members of at least one
other strain. 

### Distribution of CpG sites
We used the enrichment function in ChromHMM described above to identify 
enrichment of CpG sites around functional elements (transcription start
sites, transcription end sites, transcription factor binding sites,
promoters, enhancers, candidate cis-regulatory elements, and CpG islands)
in the mouse genome. These features are described above in the section
"Genome distribution of chromatin states." We further performed a gene-based 
analysis of abundance similar to that in the chromatin states. As a function 
of relative position on the gene body, we calculated the density of CpG sites 
as the average distance to the next downstream CpG site, as well as the percent 
methylation at each site. 

### Association of DNA methylation with gene expression
As with chromatin state, we assessed the effect of DNA methylation on gene
expression both across genes and across strains. We used the same linear 
model described above, except that $y_{s}$ became the rank Z normalized 
percent methylation either across genes or across strains. Because the 
effect of DNA methylation on gene expression is well-known to be dependent
on position, we only calculated a position-dependent effect on expression.
We did not calculate the effect of percent methylation across the full 
gene on expression.

## Imputation of genomic features in Diversity Outbred mice
To assess the extent to which chromatin state and DNA methylation 
explained local expression QTLs, we imputed local chromatin state 
and DNA methylation into the population of diversity outbred (DO) 
mice described above. We compared the effect of the imputed 
epigenetic features to imputed SNPs.

All imputations followed the same basic procedure: For each transcript, 
we identified the haplotype probabilities in the DO mice at the genetic 
marker nearest the gene transcription start site. This matrix held DO 
individuals in rows and DO founder haplotypes in columns 
(Supp. Fig. \ref{supp_fig:imputation}).

For each transcript, we also generated a three-dimensional array 
representing the genomic features (chromatin state, DNA methylation 
status, or SNP genotype) derived from the DO founders. This array 
held DO founders in rows, feature state in columns, and genomic 
position in the third dimension. The feature state for chromatin 
consisted of states one through `r num.states`, for SNPs feature state 
consisted of the genotypes A,C,G, and T.

We then multiplied the haplotype probabilities by each genomic feature 
array to obtain the imputed genomic feature for each DO mouse. This final 
array held DO individuals in rows, the genomic feature in the second 
dimension, and genomic position in the third dimension. This array is 
analagous to the genoprobs object in R/qtl2 \citep{pmid30591514}. The genomic 
position dimension included all positions from 1 kb upstream of the TSS 
to 1 kb downstream of the TES. SNP data for the DO founders in mm10 
coordinates were downloaded from the Sanger SNP database 
\citep{keane2011mouse} on July 6, 2021.

To calculate the effect of each imputed genomic feature on gene expression in
the DO population, we fit a linear model. From this linear model, we calculated 
the variance explained ($R^2$) by each genomic feature, thereby relating gene 
expression in the DO to each position of the imputed feature in and around the 
gene body. 

### Permutations

Because any feature imputed from haplotype will be somewhat correlated
with gene expression, we performed permutations of the above statistics 
to assess whether each genomic feature was significantly correlated with 
gene expression beyond the effect of the imputation itself. To do the 
permutations, we shuffled the strain labels on each genomic feature 
vector (chromatin states, DNA methylation percent, or SNPs). This 
randomized the association between haplotype and the assigned genomic 
feature while preserving the association between haplotype and gene 
expression. We then re-imputed the features into the DO and performed 
the association tests on the randomized imputed values. 

We calculated an empirical $p$-value for each transcript using 1000 
permutations. A uniform $p$-value distribution across the transcripts
would suggest that the given genomic feature was not significantly 
associated with gene expression. An enrichment of small $p$-values, 
on the other hand, would suggest that there is a significant 
association between the imputed genomic feature and gene expression 
beyond that conferred by the imputation itself. The $p$-value 
distributions for all three genomic features were highly enriched 
for small $p$-values (all Kruskal-Wallis $p < 2^{-16}$), suggesting 
that, although many individual imputed values were not significantly 
associated with gene expression, overall each genomic feature could 
be significantly associated with gene expression (Supplemental Figure XXX).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\caption{Comparison of emissions probabilities across all ChromHMM models.
Each row contains data for a single ChromHMM model fit to the number of
states indicated on either side of the row. Each set of four columns shows
data for each of the four histone modifications. Each set is separated from
the next by a column of gray for ease of visualization. The bottom row, the
reference row, shows the ideal state that all model states are being compared
to. Blue indicates absence of the histone mark and red indicates presence.
For each ChromHMM model, each state was assigned to one of the reference states
using an emissions probability of 0.3 as a threshold for presence of the histone
modification. If a state was not present in the given model, the corresponding
area is shown in gray. Emissions probabilities near 0 are shown in blue, and 
probabilities near 1 are shown in red. Orange and yellow indicate intermediate
probabilities. Aligning the states across all models shows a remarkable 
stability in the emissions across models, seen as vertical bars of consistent 
color.}

\caption{Comparison of state abundance across all ChromHMM models. The left-most column
shows the annotation for each state. Unannotated states are marked with a dash. The 
binary heatmap indicates which histone modifications were present in each state: 1 
indicates presence, and 0 indicates absence. The histone modifications are labeled
at the bottom of each column. The continuous heatmap shows the abundance of each state
(in rows) in each ChromHMM model (in columns). The abundance is the proportion of 
transcribed genes with the state present. Less abundant states are shaded blue, and 
more abundant states are shaded yellow, orange, and red. The number of states in the
model is indicated at the bottom of each column. The black box highlights the model
used in this study -- the `r num.states`-state model. State abundance was remarkably
stable across the different models.}
