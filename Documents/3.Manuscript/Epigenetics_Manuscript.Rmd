# Results

## Eight-state model correlated best with gene expression

## State proportion correlated with gene expression within-strain

## State proportion did not correlate with expression between-strain

\caption{Correlations between traits and the first principal component (PC) of
the kinship matrix. Traits with high correlation to the kinship matrix may 
be highly polygenic and thus be susceptible to test statistic inflation due to 
many true positives. To reduce this risk, we selected traits with low correlation
with the first kinship matrix PC. This figure shows the distribution of correlations
between traits and the first kinship PC across populations.

\caption{Reducing $n$ reduces inflation. 
This figure is identical to Fig. \ref{LD} except that we have added a column 
for the F2 that has been subsampled to the same $n$ as the Backcross. This 
subsampling reduces power to detect effects, and thus reduces inflation to 
roughly the same level as that seen in the backcross.
