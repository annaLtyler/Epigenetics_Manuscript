# Abstract

Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications
and DNA methylation, are important regulators of gene
expression. Variation in epigenetic modifications generates
all the different cell types in a multi-cellular organism
from the same genome. Epigenetic variation is also a 
critical component of variation in gene expression across 
genetically distinct individuals. Understanding vraiation 
in phenotypes across cell types and individuals requires 
an understanding of gene regulation. Mice are a widely 
used model of health and disease in humans, and in 
particular the diversity outbred (DO) mice and the inbred 
founders that generated this population are widely used to 
dissect the role of gene regulation in health and disease. 
Although there have been many studies linking genetic 
variation to variation in gene expression in this model,
there is little known about how epigenetic modifications 
vary in these strains. Mapping epigenetic modifications 
in this population will improve our understanding of the 
mechanisms of gene regulation in these widely used mice. 
To this end, we performed a strain survey of epigenetic 
modifications in hepatocytes of the DO founders. We also 
surveyed DBA/2J, which with C57Bl/6J is one of the founders 
of the BXD recombinant inbred strains of mice, another widely 
used population in modeling disease. We surveyed four histone 
modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K27ac), 
and DNA methylation. We used ChromHMM to identify 14 
chromatin states, each of which represented a distinct 
combination of the four histone modifications. We found 
that, in contrast to DNA methylation, chromatin state 
was strongly correlated with local gene expression across 
the inbred mice. We then imputed chromatin state and DNA 
methylation status into an independent population of 
diversity outbred (DO) mice and found that imputed chromatin 
state was more strongly correlated with variation in gene
expression than either DNA methylation status or local SNP 
genotype. We use an example to illustrate how chromatin state
can be aligned with gene expression to identify specific 
genomic regions that may mediate expression quantitative 
trait loci (eQTLs) through chromatin state variation. 
Finally, we provide a data resource that documents 
strain-specific variation in chromatin state in hepatocytes 
across nine widely used strains of laboratory mice.

# Introduction

Although different cell types in an organism house the same 
genome, each has a distinct pattern of gene expression. These
cell-type specific patterns of expression are established 
through epigenetic modification of both histones 
\citep{pmid32671792, pmid29625185} and DNA methylation 
\citep{pmid21701563, pmid20720541}, which influence the 
accessibility of DNA to transcription machinery
\citep{lawrence2016lateral, jones2012functions, moore2013dna}. 

This variation in epigenetic landscapes across cell types 
has been extensively documented \citep{pmid21441907, pmid25693563}
and has been used to richly annotate functional elements in 
both mouse \citep{stamatoyannopoulos2012encyclopedia, baker2019tissue, yue2014comparative} 
and human genomes \citep{pmid25693563, pmid23595227, pmid20657582}. 
Such functional annotations provide insight into mechanisms 
of gene regulation. Because the majority of disease-associated 
genetic variants discovered in humans are in gene regulatory 
regions, it has been suggested that it is the regulation of 
gene expression, rather than alteration of protein function, 
that is the primary mechanism through which genetic variation 
confers disease risk 
\citep{maurano2012systematic, farh2015genetic, pmid21617055, pmid19474294}.
Detailed epigenomic landscapes, therefore, may provide important
mechanistic insight linking genotype to disease risk.

Work in humans \citep{mcvicker2013identification, kang2021genetic}, 
rats \citep{rintisch2014natural}, and cattle 
\citep{prowse2022genetic} have linked genetic variation 
across individuals to variation in the histone landscape.
Such variation can alter gene regulation through the
disruption of transcription factor binding sites and 
other mechanisms \citep{mcvicker2013identification}. 
In support of this idea, genetic loci associated with 
variability in the histone landscape frequently overlap 
with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) \citep{kang2021genetic, 
rintisch2014natural, prowse2022genetic} and genetic loci 
associated with clinical outcomes \citep{kang2021genetic}.
For example, genetic variants in the promoters of CAPN1 and 
LINC00959 which were associated with variation in H3K4me3 
and H3K27ac modifications, were also associated with 
variation in expression of the locally encoded genes 
and with patient outcomes following surgery for lung 
adenocarcenoma \citet{kang2021genetic}. Similarly, studies 
have identified genetic loci that are associated both 
with variation in DNA methylation and higher level 
clinical outcomes such as immune dysregulation and 
asthma \citep{hawe2022genetic}.

This body of work demonstrates the important links 
between genetic variation, epigenetic variation, and 
higher level phenotypes. Thus, mapping variation of 
the epigenetic landscape in models of human disease 
is critical to understanding mechanisms of gene 
regulation in these models. Laboratory mice are one 
of the most widely used models of human disease, and 
yet there is little known about the landscape of 
epigenetic modifications in these animals. 

In the last decades the development of the diversity 
outbred (DO) mice \citep{Svenson:2012hq, churchill2012diversity, 
koyuncu2021cxcl1, kurtz2020diversity, bogue2015collaborative, 
kebede2014insights, keller2019gene} and their sister population, 
the collaborative cross (CC) mice \citep{threadgill2011collaborative, 
threadgill2012ten, durrant2011collaborative, mao2015identification, 
graham2021baseline}, has demonstrated the critical importance of 
genetic diversity in our understanding of disease biology.
However, the epigenetic landscape in these important models is 
still relatively unexplored. To address this gap in knowledge, we 
undertook a strain survey of epigenetic variation in hepatocytes 
across the eight founders of the DO/CC mice, as well as DBA/2J, 
which, along with C57BL/6J, is one of the founders of 
the widely used BxD recombinant inbred panel of mice 
\citep{Ashbrook:2019bd}. We assayed four histone 
modifications: H3K4me3, which is associated with promoter 
regions \citep{heintzman2007distinct, pmid15680324}, H3K4me1, 
which is associated with enhancer regions \citep{heintzman2007distinct},
H3K27me3, which is associated with polycomb repression \citep{bonasio2010molecular}, 
and H3K27ac, which has been associated with enhancement of active 
enhancers and promoters \citep{creyghton2010histone, heintzman2009histone, rada2011unique}.
We also assayed DNA methylation which is associated with 
variation in gene expression depending on its position
relative to the gene \citep{moore2013dna, jones2012functions}.
Methylation of DNA in promoters reduces gene expression, whereas
methylation of DNA in insulators reduces the effect of the insulator
thereby increasing expression of the targeted gene \citep{jones2012functions}.

We used ChromHMM \citep{Ernst:2012ii} to identify `r num.states` 
chromatin states, each representing a unique combination of 
the four histone marks. We investigated the association between 
variation in these states and variation in gene expression across 
the nine strains. We also investigated the relationship between 
DNA methylation and gene expression across strains.

We further investigated the relationship between epigenetic state 
and local regulation of gene expression by imputing the 
`r num.states` chromatin states and DNA methylation into a 
population of DO mice. We then mapped gene expression to the 
imputed epigenetic states to assess the extent to which expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in the DO were related to variation 
in epigenetic modifications. 

# Results

Both gene expression and epigenetic state were consistent within 
mouse strains but varied across the strains suggesting strong 
genetic regulation of both modalities. This is seen as a 
clustering of individuals from the same strain in principal 
component plots of transcriptomic and epigenetic features 
(Figure \ref{fig:pc_plots}). Patterns of gene 
expression (Figure \ref{fig:pc_plots}A), DNA methylation (Figure 
\ref{fig:pc_plots}B) and individual histone modifications (Figure 
\ref{fig:pc_plots}C-F) clustered in similar patterns although a 
relatively small percent of the variation in the methylome was
related to strain. The three subspecies \textit{musculus} (in red), 
\textit{castaneous} (in green)
and \textit{domesticus} (all others) were widely separated suggesting
that subspecies structure made up the majority of the observed variance. 
The \text{domesticus} strains largely clustered together. These data 
provide evidence that epigenetic features relate to gene expression 
in a manner that is consistent with the subspecific origin of the 
mouse strains \citep{yang2007subspecific}. For a more detailed 
visualization of the correlations between strains, see Supplemental 
Figure XXX.

## Chromatin state overview

We used ChromHMM to identify `r num.states` chromatin states 
composed of unique combinations of the four histone modifications
(Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}A). We calculated the enrichment 
of each state near predicted functional elements in the mouse
liver (Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}B), and correlated the
presence of each state with gene expression both across genes
and across the inbred mouse strains (Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}C).

\caption{Overview of chromatin state composition, genomic 
distribution, and effect on expression. (A) Emission 
probabilites for each histone modification in each

state is enriched near the annotated functional element.

annotations for each state based on genomic enrichments. The numbers 
in parentheses indicate the percent of the genome that was assigned 
to each state. Repress. = repressor.}
\label{fig:state_overview}
\end{figure}

To associate chromatin state with expression across transcripts,
we calculated the proportion of the gene body that was occupied by each
state in each inbred strain. We then fit a linear model to associate
the proportion of each chromatin state with the amount of transcription
within each strain (Methods). We compared this to the correlation 
between chromatin state and gene expression *across* strains (Methods). 
For any given transcript, a strain with more active enhancer would 
be expected to have higher expression than a strain with less active 
enhancer in that gene. Through this calculation, we can correlate strain 
variation in gene expression to strain variation in chromatin state. 

By merging the histone modification combinations, with functional
element enrichments, and associations with gene expression, we could 
assign putative annotatations to each of the `r num.states` chromatin 
states (Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}D).

In Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}, the states are ordered by their
association with gene expression across strains, which helps illustrate 
several patterns. Overall, states that were associated with increased 
expression across transcripts were also associated with increased 
expression when varying across strains. The state with the largest 
negative association with gene expression across strains, 
State `r nomark.state`, was the absence of all measured modifications. 
Other states associated with reduced gene expression contained the 
repressive mark H3K27me3. The states with the largest positive effects 
on expression all had some combination of the activating marks, H3K4me3, 
H3K4me1, and H3K27ac. The repressive mark was less commonly seen in 
these activating states. 

Except for State `r nomark.state`, all states were enriched around 
at least one of the predicted predicted functional elements in 
mouse liver (Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}B). Interestingly, 
the annotations of these states largely matched the associations 
we saw between each state and gene expression 
(Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}C). For example, State
`r active.enhancer.state`, which was enriched 
around strong enhancers, was the state that was most strongly corrlated 
with increased expression both across genes, and across strains. 
Likewise, States 2-4 were all enriched around active enhancers or 
promoters, and were all correlated with increased expression overall. 

At the other end of the spectrum, state `r repressor.state` was 
enriched around polycomb repressor marks, as we would expect 
because it was defined by H3K27me3, which is associated with
polycomb repression. This state was also correlated with reduced
expression both across genes and across strains. 

Many of the states with weaker effects, both positive and negative
were most enriched around bivalent promoters. This suggests that 
the bivalent promoter class may represent a diverse array of 
functional elements with varied effects on gene expression, and that
more detailed experiments investigating the relationship between 
these states and gene expression could potentially identify novel 
chromatin states influencing expression in these cells. 

## DNA methylation overview

To investigate the variation in DNA methylation across the
the inbred strains, we examined both strain-specific CpG 
sites and strain-specific methylation values. We defined a 
strain-specific CpG site as one that was present in all 
individuals in at least one strain and absent in all 
individuals in at least one other strain (Methods).

Across all chromosomes between 16% and 19% of CpG sites were
strain-specific (Supplemental Figure XXX). Strain-specific
CpG sites were more commonly present in CAST, PWK, and B6
compared to the other strains (Spplemental Figure XXX).

CpG sites that were present in all strains were enriched
around genomic features such as CpG islands and promoters 
(Methods) (Supplemental Figure XXX). Strain-specific CpG
sites were also enriched around CpG sites and promoters.
However, relative to the CpG sites found across all strains,
the strain-specific CpG sites were more strongly enriched 
specifically in enhancers, especially TSS-distal poised 
enhancers and weak enhancers (Supplemental Figure XXX).
Relative to the CpG sites common across all strains, 
strain-specific sites were depleted in promoter regions 
and CpG islands (Supplemental Figure XXX) suggesting that
variation in DNA methylation across strains primarily 
occurs in enhancers that fine-tune gene expression levels
rather than in promoters which might result in genes 
being turned on or off.

## Spatial distribution of epigenetic modifications around gene bodies

In addition to looking for enrichment of chromatin states and
CpG sites near annotated functional elements, we characterized 
the fine-grained spatial distribution of these features around 
gene bodies by normalizing gene position to run from 0 at the 
TSS to 1 at the TES (See Methods) (Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance})

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics[width=0.67\textwidth]{Figures/Fig3_Abundance.png} 
\caption{Relative abundance of chromatin states and methylated DNA. (A) Each panel 
shows the abundance of a single chromatin state relative to gene TSS and TES. The 
$y$-axis in each panel is the proportion of genes containing the state. Each
panel has an independent $y$-axis to better show the shape of each curve.
The $x$-axis is the relative gene position. The TSS and TES are marked as vertical
gray dashed lines. (B) The same data shown in panel A, but with all states overlayed
onto a single set of axes to show the relative abundance of the states. 
(C) The density of CpG sites relative to the gene body. The $y$-axis shows the 
number of CpG sites per base pair. The density is highest near the TSS. 
CpG sites are less dense within the gene body and in the intergenic space. 
(D) Percent methylation relative to the gene body. The $y$-axis shows the median 
percent methylation at CpG sites, and the $x$-axis shows relative gene position. 
CpG sites near the TSS are unmethylated relative to intragenic sites and to sites
just upstream and downstream of the gene bodies. In both C and D standard error 
is shown as a blue envelope around the mean; however, the standard error is so 
small that it is not visible in the figure.}
\label{fig:state_abundance}
\end{figure}

The spatial patterns of the individual chromatin states are shown 
in (Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}A), and an overlay of all 
states together (Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}B) emphasizes the
difference in abundance between the most abundant states (States 
`r active.enhancer.state`, `r active.promoter.state`, and 
`r nomark.state`), and the remaining states, which were 
relatively rare.

Each chromatin state had a characteristic distribution pattern
across the gene body. For example, State `r nomark.state`, 
which was characterized by the absence of all measured histone 
modifications, was strongly depleted near the TSS, indicating 
that this region is commonly subject to the histone modifications 
we measured here. It should be noted this this pattern is independent
of the global enrichment patterns shown in Figure (XXX). Although
state `r nomark.state` is generally depleted in gene bodies relative
to intergenic regions, it is especially depleted at the TSS.
In contrast, States `r active.enhancer.state` and `r active.promoter.state` 
were both relatively abundant at the TSS. State `r active.promoter.state` 
was very narrowly concentrated right at the TSS, consistent with
its annotation as an active promoter (Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}). 
State `r active.enhancer.state` on the other hand, was especially 
enriched just upstream of the TSS, consistent with its annotation 
of a TSS-proximal strong enhancer. State `r strong.intragenic.enhancer`, 
was depleted nere the TSS, but enriched within the gene body, consistent 
with its annotation of a TSS-distal enhancer.

States with weaker associations to expression (indicated by grayer
shades in Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}) were of lower abundance, 
but had distinct distribution patterns around the gene body suggesting 
the possibility of distinct functional roles in the regulation of gene 
expression. The abundance patterns were identical across all strains 
(Supplemental Figure XXX)

DNA methylation showed similarly characteristic variation in abundance
(Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}C-D). The TSS had densely packed 
CpG sites relative to the gene body (Figure 
\ref{fig:state_abundance}C). As expected, the median CpG site near 
the TSS was consistently hypomethylated relative to the median CpG 
site in intra- and intergenic regions (Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}D).
All genes used in this analysis were expressed and thus had some 
degree of hypomethylation. There were also no large-scale difference
in CpG distribution or percent methylation across strains 
(Supplemental Figure XXX).

## Spatially resolved effects on gene expression

The distinct spatial distributions of the chromatin states and 
methylated CpG sites around the gene body raised the question 
as to whether the effects of these states on gene expression 
could also be spatially resolved. To investigate this possibility 
we tested the association between gene expression and both 
chromatin state and DNA methylation using spatially resolved models
(Methods). We tested the effect of each chromatin state on 
expression across genes within hepatocytes (Figure 
\ref{fig:state_effects}A) and the effect of each chromatin state 
on the variation in gene expression across strains (Figure 
\ref{fig:state_effects}B).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/Fig4_Effects.png}
\caption{Effects of chromatin states on gene expression. Each column shows 
the effect of each chromatin state on gene expression in a different 
experimental context. The first column shows the effect across genes in 
the inbred mice showing how chromatin states are used within hepatocytes 
to increase the expression of some genes and decrease the expression 
of other genes. The second column shows the effect of chromatin state 
on gene expression across strains. The third column shows the effect 
of imputed chromatin state on gene expression in a population of diversity 
outbred mice. These plots show the effect on local gene expression of 
variation in chromatin state across genetically diverse individuals. 
Each column of panels is plotted on a single scale for the $y$-axis so 
the magnitude of the effects in a single column can be compared directly 
to each other. All $y$-axes are centered around 0 (black horizontal line). 
Across a single row, the scale of the $y$-axis varies to highlight the 
similarity of the shape of each curve in each different setting. Values 
above the zero line indicate a positive correlation between the state and 
gene expression at that genomic position. Labels on the $y$-axis in the 
first column are in arbitrary units and indicate where the 0 line is as 
well as positive and negative effects. Values below the zero line indicate 
a negative correlation between the state and gene expression at that genomic 
positin. The colored areas indicate the 95\% confidence interval around the 
mean estimate. The final column shows the annotation of each state for 
comparison with its effects on gene expression. All $y$-axes show the 
$\beta$ coefficient from the linear model shown in equation 1. All 
$x$-axes show the relative position along the gene body running from 
just upstream of the TSS to just downstream of the TES. Vertical gray 
dashed lines mark the TSS and TES in all panels.
}
\label{fig:state_effects}
\end{figure}

All chromatin states demonstrated spatially dependent effects 
on gene expression within hepatocytes. Figure \ref{fig:state_effects}
shows how these effects are distributed across the states 
and across the gene bodies. In each panel the $y$-axis is centered
around zero (black horizontal line). Effects above this line indicate
the state had a positive association with gene expression, whereas
effects below the center line show the state had a negative correlation
with gene expression at that particular position.

For many of the states, the effects on expression were concentrated 
at or near the TSS, while in the other states effects were seen across 
the whole gene. The direction of the effects matched the overall effects 
of each state seen previously (Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}), but here
we see finer resolution on the effect. For example, State 
`r active.promoter.state` was positively correlated overall with gene 
expression (Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}C), but in Figure 
\ref{fig:state_effects} we see that this positive correlation is 
primarily limited to the region near the TSS, consistent with its
annotation as a promoter state.

Further, the spatial effects observed across genes 
(Figure \ref{fig:state_effects} first column) were largely recapitulated 
in the measurements across strains ((Figure \ref{fig:state_effects} middle 
column)). That is, chromatin states that either enhanced or suppressed gene 
expression across hepatocyte genes were similarly related to variation in 
expression across strains. This suggests that the genetic differences 
between strains modify chromatin activity in a manner similar to that 
used across genes. One notable exception was State 
`r weak.intragenic.enhancer`, whose presence upregulated genes within 
hepatocytes, but did not contribute to expression variation across strains.

We also examined the effect of percent DNA methylation across genes 
within hepatocytes and across strains (Figure 
\ref{fig:DNA_methylation_effect}). As expected, methylation at 
the TSS was associated with lower expressed genes in hepatocytes
(Figure \ref{fig:DNA_methylation_effect}A). 
We did not detect an association between DNA methylation percent
and gene expression across inbred strains, perhaps because there
were too few strains to reliabley estimate the effects 
((Figure \ref{fig:DNA_methylation_effect}B)). However,
we did see a significant negative association between DNA 
methylation and gene expression when we imputed DNA methylation 
in the DO (Figure \ref{fig:DNA_methylation_effect}C). 
These results suggest that heritably DNA methylation contributes
significantly to eQTL in genetically diverse individuals.

## Interactions between chromatin state and DNA methylation

We investigated whether there was an interaction between DNA
methylation and chromatin state by asking two questions. First,
were CpG sites within different chromatin states methylated at
different levels? And second, was DNA methylation within specific
chromatin states differentially associated with gene 
expression across inbred mice? If DNA methylation essentially
inactivates a region of DNA, methylation in a region identified
as a repressor based on its chromatin state might be expected 
to increase gene expression, whereas methylation in an active 
enhancer might decrease gene expression. 

To investigate these questions, we identified CpG sites within 
each of the `r num.states` chromatin states. We calculated the 
average percent methylation of these sites, and the effect of 
DNA methylation on gene expression for each set of sites (Methods). 
We treated missing CpG sites in individual strains as unmethylated.

Although methylation patterns in all states followed roughly the same
pattern of unmethylated at the transcription start site and methylated
within the gene body, values ranged widely across the states from State
`r active.promoter.state` with a mean of 27\% methylated DNA intragenically,
to State `r nomark.state` with 83\% methylated DNA intragenically. Again,
these differential levels of methylation within these states are 
consistent with the state annotations. State `r active.promoter.state`
was annotated as an active promoter, and we would expect DNA methylation
in this state to be low. State `r nomark.state` has no histone modifications
and is not expected to be transcriptionally active, which is consistent
with high levels of DNA methylation.

DNA methylation in a subset of the chromatin states was significantly
correlated with gene expression (Supplemental Figure XXX). DNA 
methylation in State `r active.promoter.state`, the active promoter 
state, was associated with decreased gene expression, suggesting that 
DNA methylation in this state deactivated the active promoter state.
Overall, State `r bivalent.promoter.state`, a
state annotated as a bivalent promoter, was negatively associated
with gene expression. However, DNA methylation in this state was 
positively associated with gene expression, suggesting that 
this repressive state can be inactivated by DNA methylation.

## Imputed chromatin state explained expression variation in diversity outbred mice

Thus far, we have shown correlations between gene expression and 
epigenetic features in inbred mice. We were also interested in 
whether chromatin state and DNA methylation were associated with 
gene expression in an outbred mouse population. Although we did not 
measure epigenetic modifications directly in an outbred population,
we had liver gene expression from a previously published population 
of diversity outbred mice \citep{pmid28592500}. Inheritance of chromatin
state and DNA methylation is complex \citep{rintisch2014natural}; 
however there is evidence that the heritability for both epigenetic 
features is high \citep{pmid16009939; pmid33931130} suggesting the 
possibility of imputing epigenetic features from local genotype into
the DO mice. Even with imperfect estimates of epigenetic features in 
the outbred mice, a common pattern of association between outbred and
inbred mice would support the idea that inherited variance in epigenetic 
features contributes to inherited variation in gene expression across 
genetically distinct individuals.

We imputed chromatin state, DNA methylation, and SNPs into the DO 
population (Methods). Because any feature imputed from haplotype 
will be correlated with gene expression, we performed permutations 
that shuffled the relationship between haplotype and chromatin state 
(Methods). The resulting $p$-value distributions of each genomic 
feature suggested that each imputed feature was significantly associated
with gene expression in the DO beyond the effects of the imputation 
alone.

We then tested the association between each chromatin state, each SNP,
or each CpG site with gene expression in the DO. We tested each state
independently to constrain the degrees of freedom for each feature to one.
In parallel, we tested the association between each local haplotype state
and gene expression in the DO. This is not the standard method for testing
associations between markers and gene expression in this type of population,
but it constrains the degrees of freedom to one so we can compare the 
effect of each individual haplotype to each individual chromatin state.

Haplotypes are a measure of ancestry, whereas chromatin state, DNA 
methylation, and SNPs are all potentially functional variation in 
the genome. Thus any individual chromatin state, SNP, or CpG site 
can theoretically explain more variance in gene expression than an 
individual haplotype. 

Figure \ref{fig:effect_distrubutions} compares the variance 
explained by individual haplotypes with that explained by 
any individual chromatin state, CpG site, or SNP. All imputed
features--individual chromatin states (14\%), DNA methylation 
(14\%), and SNPs (13\%)--explained more variance than individual 
haplotypes (11\%) (Figure \ref{fig:effect_distrubutions}A). This
suggests that any given chromatin state, CpG site, or SNP carries
more functional inforation than an individual haplotype, which is
primarily a measurement of ancestry.
CpG sites explained the least amount of variance overall, but was
comparable to haplotype. Figure \ref{fig:effect_distrubutions}B 
shows the maximum variance explained by each genomic feature 
for each transcript in the transcriptome. Dots above the line 
indicate transcripts for which the imputed genomic feature explained 
more variance than haplotype. Dots below the line indicate transcripts
for which the imputed genomic feature explained less variance
than haplotype. There are many dots above the line for all features,
particularly chromatin state and SNPs, supporting the hypothesis
that all these features cary heritable information that potentially
regulates gene expression in this genetically diverse population. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]

variance explained by local haplotype, and each of the other 
genomic features. Blue lines show $y = x$. Each point is a 
single transcript.}
\label{fig:effect_distrubutions}
\end{figure}

For many genes, individual chromatin states, SNPs, or CpG sites 
was more highly associated with gene expression than individual 
haplotypes. For these genes, it is likely that multiple haplotypes
carry a common functional element that is associated with gene 
expression. This occurence provides an opportunity to annotate 
novel functional elements in the mouse genome, or provide supportive
evidence of previously predicted functional elements. As an example, 
we investigated the gene \textit{Pkd2} (Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}). 

For \textit{Pkd2}, WSB and PWK are low-expressing strains, and the 
remaining strains have higher expression 
(Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}E). The haplotype effects
in the DO mirror this pattern with the CAST allele showing an
especially high association with increased gene expression. 

To investigate whether natural variation in chromatin state can be used
to identify putative \textit{cis} regulatory regions the mouse genome, 
we looked at the relationship between chromatin state and gene expression 
in individual genes. An example gene, \textit{Pkd2}, is shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:example_gene}. This figure shows chromatin state (Figure 
\ref{fig:example_gene}B), SNP genotype (Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}C), 
and DNA methylation (Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}D) status along the 
gene body of \textit{Pkd2}. It also shows the association of each of 
these features with gene expression calculated across the whole gene 
body (Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}A).

The detailed view of this gene identifies two particularly interesting
regions (gray arrows Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}A). One is at the 
TSS and the immediately surrounding area, and the other is just downstream 
of the TSS. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/Fig7_Example.png} 
\caption{Example of epigenetic states and imputation results for a single

all panels B through F are shown in the same order as the haplotype effects.}
\label{fig:example_gene}
\end{figure}

These two regions were both strongly associated expression levels 
(Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}A). Those strains with activating
histone states in these regions had much higher expression
of \textit{Pkd2} than the two strains that did not have activating
states in this region. We hypothesize that these two regions are
enhancers.

The spatial patterns in the SNPs only partially mirror those in chromatin 
state (Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}C). SNPs underlying the putative 
enhancer region at the TSS could potentially influence gene expression by 
altering local chromatin state. However, the more downstream enhancer has 
no underlying SNPs, suggesting that there is an alternative mechanism for 
determining chromatin state at this location. Perhaps SNPs in the TSS region
regulate both enhancers.

Percent DNA methylation does not vary across the strains in either of these 
putative enhancer regions, and does not contribute to variation in expression 
across genetically distinct individuals (Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}D). 


# Discussion

In this study we showed that genetic variation across inbred
mice is associated with variation in histone modifications
and DNA methylation in hepatocytes. We further showed that 
the variation in histone modifications was highly related 
to variation in gene expression across strains. These 
observations support the idea that heritable variation in 
epigenetic factors is an important molecular mechanism 
contributing to interindividual variation in gene expression. 
This hypothesis was supported by the high concordance between 
chromatin state, which was imputed from local genotype, and 
gene expression in an independent outbred population of mice. 

Although we did not see an association between variation in 
DNA methylation and variation in gene expression across inbred
mouse strains, we did see an association between imputed DNA 
methylation and gene expression in DO mice. Namely increased
methylation near the TSS was associated with reduced gene 
expression. It is unclear why this discrepancy between inbred
and outbred mice arose. The variation in DNA methylation across
strains was much smaller than the variation in chromatin state,
particularly at the TSS. 

 in In contrast to chromatin state, percent DNA methylation was not 
associated with variation in gene expression across inbred 
strains or in the outbred population. At the TSS, this was 
largely due to a lack of variation in methylation across strains. 
An example of this observation is shown in panel D of Figure 
\ref{fig:example_gene}. Despite strain variation in both genotype 
and chromatin state at the TSS of \textit{Pkd2}, DNA methylation 
was invariant -- the CpG island at the TSS is unmethylated in all 
strains. Thus, although chromatin state appears to be highly 
influenced by local haplotype, percent DNA methylation is not.
CpG islands are highly conserved across vertebrates \citep{papin2021cpg}
and may thus be regions of low genetic variation within this study 
relative to the surrounding regions in which SNPs and variations
in histone modifications are abundant.

Variation in DNA methylation has shown a similar lack of association
with gene expression in humans \citep{pmid33931130}. Multiple twin studies 
have estimated the average heritability of individual CpG sites to be 
roughly 0.19 \citep{pmid27051996, pmid24183450, pmid22532803}, with only 
about 10\% of CpG sites having a heritability greater than 0.5 
\citep{pmid24183450, pmid22532803, pmid24887635}. Trimodal CpG sites, 
i.e. those with methylation percent varying among 0, 50, and 100\%, 
have been shown in human brain tissue to be more heritable than 
unimodal, or bimodal sites ($h^2 = 0.8 \pm 0.18$), and roughly half 
were associated with local eQTL \citep{pmid20485568}. Here, we did not 
see an association between trimodal CpG sites and gene expression 
across strains (Supplemental Figure \ref{supp_fig:trimodal}).

The diversity in the effects observed in the `r num.states` chromatin 
states highlights the importance of analyzing combinatorial states as 
opposed to individual histone modifications. To illustrate this point, 
consider the three states with the largest positive effects on 
transcription. Each of these three states had a distinct combination 
of the three activatin histone marks: H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac. 
And although all three states were associated with increased gene 
expression, each had a distinct spatial distribution. This variation 
in spatial distribution was mirrored in the spatial effects on 
transcription. These distinct patterns would not be detectable 
without analysis of the histone modifications in combination. 
These results highlight the complexity of the histone code 
and the importance at analyzing combinatorial states.

While we were able to annotate several states, particularly those
with the strongest effects on gene expression, other states were 
more difficult to annotate. This raises the intruiguing possibility 
of identifying new modes of expression regulation through histone 
modification. One of these unannotated states, State `r unknown.state`, 
had a weak, but consistent negative effect on gene transcription centered 
within the gene body downstream of the TSS. This state was characterized 
by high levels of H3K4me3 and low levels of the other three modifications. 

The modification H3K4me3 is most frequently associated with increased 
transcriptional activity 
\citep{pmid15680324, pmid14661024, pmid12353038, pmid16728976}, so the 
association with state 
`r unknown.state` with reduced transcription is a deviation from the 
dominant paradigm. The physical distribution of this state is also
interesting. It was depleted at the TSS, but enriched just upstream 
and just downstream of the TSS. It was also enriched just downstream 
of the TES, although it did not appear to influence transcription at 
this location. The group of genes marked by State `r unknown.state` 
were enriched for functions such as stress response, DNA damage repair, 
and ncRNA processing suggesting that this state may be used to regulate 
subsets of genes involved in responses to environmental stimuli.

We detected two bivalent states in this survey. Bivalent states are 
characterized by a combination of activating and repressing histone 
modifications, and are usually associated with undifferentiated cells 
\citep{pmid23788621, pmid22513113}. Here we identified two bivalent 
states in adult mouse hepatocytes, and annotated them as a poised 
enhancer (State `r poised.enhancer.state`) and a bivalent 
promoter (State `r bivalent.promoter.state`). Both states were 
associated with downregulation across inbred strains when present 
near the TSS; however this effect was not replicated in the outbred 
mice. The lack of replication may be because the effect was too 
weak to detect given the number of animals in the population. 

Both bivalent promoters and poised enhancers are dynamic states that 
change over the course of differentiation and in response to external 
stimuli. Bivalent promoters have been studied primarily in 
the context of development. They are abundant in undifferentiated cells, 
and are typically resolved either to active promoters or to silenced 
promoters as the cells differentiate into their final state 
\citep{pmid23788621, pmid22513113}. These promoters have also been shown 
to be important in the response to changes in the environment. Their 
abundance increases in breast cancer cells in response to hypoxia 
\citep{pmid27800026}. Poised enhancers are also observed during differentiation 
and in differentiated cells \citep{pmid32432110}. In concordance with these 
previous observations, the genes marked by States `r bivalent.promoter.state` 
and `r poised.enhancer.state` were enriched for vascular development 
and morphogenesis. That we identified these states in differentiated 
hepatocytes may indicate that a subset of developmental genes retain 
the ability to be activated under certain circumstances, such as during 
liver regeneration in response to damage. It is also possible these 
states were induced in the inbred strains in respose to stress, rather 
than genetically coded. This could also explain why the negative effect 
on gene expression was not replicated in the outbred mice. However, given 
that we detected this state in all nine inbred strains in relatively 
equal proportions, this latter hypothesis seems less likely. 

The variation of chromatin state across strains, and its 
correspondence with expression variation offers a unique
way to identify gene regulatory regions. Genetic variation
serves as a natural perturbation to the regulatory regions,
and resulting differences in regulatory annotations can 
then be linked to variation in gene expression. The 
\textit{Pkd2} example illustrates how genetic and 
epigenetic variation can be combined to identify putative 
\textit{cis}-regulatory regions for the gene. Given that 
there is a \textit{cis}-eQTL at this locus, and that imputed 
chromatin state explains a large amount of variance in DO gene 
expression, we looked more closely at chromatin state within 
the inbred founders to identify putative cis-regulatory regions 
(Figure 7A arrows). The variation in chromatin state across the 
inbred strains in these regions is highly correlated with gene 
expression in the outbred animals, pointing to possible molecular 
mechanisms for the observed eQTL. The PWK and WSB haplotypes lack 
the enhancer elements seen in the other six haplotypes, which 
appears to reduce gene expression in these strains. Further, 
the haplotypes with broader enhancer regions also appear to have
higher \textit{Pkd2} expression suggesting that the width of the 
enhancer region also contributes to increased gene expression. 
Validation of these regions is beyond the scope of this study, 
but our results suggest that combining DO eQTL dat with inbred 
epigenetic data may serve as an important resource in identifying 
putative gene regulatory regions.

The discordance between the patterns of chromatin state and 
SNPs in this gene is particularly interesting. Variation in 
chromatin state at the intragenic enhancer is present in the 
absence of local SNPs. This suggests that the presence of the 
downstream enhancer is determined by another mechanism, perhaps 
SNPs acting in *trans* to this region, or local variation, such 
as indels, that was not measured by SNP genotyping. Genetic 
variation located at a distance from the putative enhancer sites
could also potentially alter the 3D configuration of the genome
resulting in variable access of transcription factors to the 
enhancer. 

Broadly, local variation in chromatin state was highly correlated with
variation in gene expression across individuals, an observation that
was replicated in an independent population of genetically diverse, 
outbred mice. The percent variance explained by chromatin state closely
matched that of haplotype, and exceeded that of individual SNPs. These
results suggest two things: First, a large portion of the effect of 
local haplotype on gene expression in mice may be mediated through 
variation in chromatin state. Second, the intermediate resolution of 
chromatin state between that of individual SNPs and broad haplotypes 
carries important infornation that cannot be resolved at the other
levels. Individual SNPs, although, sometimes causally linked to 
trait variation, are highly redundant and cannot be readily used to 
annotate functional elements in the genome. Haplotypes aggregate genomic
information over broad regions and are a powerful tool to link genomic
variation to trait variation. However, they are usually too broad to 
be used to annotate regions less than a few megabases in length. By 
combining the mapping power of haplotypes, the high resolution of SNPs, 
and the intermediate resolution of chromatin states, we can begin to 
build mechanistic hypotheses that link genetic variation to variation 
in gene expression and physiology. Understanding the role that genetic 
variation plays in modifying the chromatin state landscape will be 
critical in making these links. Through this survey we are providing 
a rigorous resource that explores the connection between genetic 
variation and epigenetic variation. Researchers in the wider 
community can query the epigenetic landscape of the nine DO/CC
inbred founders to identify candidate regulatory regions in genes
of interest and generate mechanistic hypotheses linking genetic 
variation to gene expression.

# Materials and Methods

## Ethics Statement

All animal procedures followed Association for Assessment and Accreditation of 
Laboratory Animal Care guidelines and were approved by Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee (The Jackson Laboratory, Protocol AUS #04008).

## Inbred Mice

Three female mice from each of nine inbred strains were used.
Eight of these strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ,
NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) are the eight 
strains that served as founders of the Collaborative 
Cross/Diversity Outbred mice \citep{Chesler:2008ge}. The ninth strain, DBA/2J, 
will facilitate the interpretation of existing and forthcoming 
genetic mapping data obtained from the BxD recombinant inbred 
strain panel. Samples were harvested from the mice at 12 
weeks of age.

### Liver perfusion

To purify hepatocytes from the liver cell population, the mouse livers 
were perfused with 87 CDU/mL Liberase collagenase with 0.02\% CaCl2 in 
Leffert's buffer to digest the liver into a single-cell suspension, 
and then isolated using centrifugation. 

We aliquoted $5 \times 10^{6}$ cells for each RNA-Seq and bisulfite sequencing, 
and the rest were cross-linked for ChIP assays. Both aliquots were spun down
at 200 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in $1200\mu L$ RTL+BME (for RNA-Seq) 
or frozen as a cell pellet in liquid nitrogen (for bisulfite sequencing). 
In the sample for ChIP-Seq, protein complexes were cross-linked to DNA
using 37\% formaldehyde in methanol. All cell samples were stored at -80°C 
until used (See Supplemental Methods for more detail). 

### Hepatocyte histone binding and gene expression assays
 
Hepatocyte samples were used in the following assays:
 
1. RNA-seq to quantify mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression, with 
  approximately 30 million reads per sample. 
2. Reduced-representation bisulfate sequencing to identify methylation 
  states of approximately two million CpG sites in the genome. The average 
  read depth was 20-30x. 
4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing to assess binding of the 
  following histone marks: 
    a. H3K4me3 to map active promoters 
    b. H3K4me1 to identify active and poised enhancers 
    c. H3K27me3 to identify closed chromatin
    d. H3K27ac, to identify actively used enhancers 
    e. A negative control (input chromatin) 

Samples were sequenced with $\sim40$ million reads per sample.

The samples for RNA-Seq in RTL+BME buffer were sent to The Jackson Laboratory 
Gene Expression Service for RNA extraction and library synthesis.

### Histone chromatin immunoprecipitation assays

After extraction, hepatocyte cells were lysed to release the nuclei,
spun down, and resuspended in 130ul MNase buffer with 1mM PMSF (Sigma, #78830)
and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) to prevent histone protein degradation. 
The samples were then digested with 15U of micrococcal nuclease (MNase), 
which digests the exposed DNA, but leaves the nucleosome-bound DNA intact.
We confirmed digestion of nucleosomes into 150bp fragments with 
agarose gel. The digestion reaction was stopped with EDTA and samples 
were used immediately in the ChIP assay. The ChIP assay was performed with
Dynabead Protein G beads and histone antibodies (H3K4me3: Millipore #07-473,
H3K4me1: Millipore #07-436, H3K27me3: Millipore #07-449, H4K27ac: abcam ab4729). 
After binding to antibodies, samples were washed to remove unbound chromatin 
and then eluted with high-salt buffer and proteinase K to digest protein away 
from DNA-protein complexes. The DNA was purified using the Qiagen PCR 
purification kit. Quantification was performed using the Qubit quantification 
system (See Supplemental Methods).

## Diversity Outbred mice
We used previously published data from a population of 478 diversity outbred 
(DO) mice \citep{Svenson:2012hq}. DO mice (JAX:DO) are available from The 
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) (stock number 009376).
The DO population included males and females from DO generations four 
through 11. Mice were randomly assigned to either a chow diet (6% fat by 
weight, LabDiet 5K52, LabDiet, Scott Distributing, Hudson, NH), or a high-fat, 
high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet (45\% fat, 40\% carbohydrates, and 15\% protein) 
(Envigo Teklad TD.08811, Envigo, Madison, WI). Mice were maintained on this 
diet for 26 weeks. 

To get the best estimates of the associations between epigenetic 
states and gene expression, we used all animals in the DO population
and regressed out the effects of sex and diet from all variables
before testing for associations. However, because the inbred animals 
used in this study were females maintained on a chow diet, it is possible
that either sex or diet could affect the results. To test whether sex
or diet had any effect on the associations between epigenetic features
and gene expression, we performed all tests using only females, and again 
only with animals fed chow. Neither subset of the DO animals affected 
the results, so all results presented here use all animals.

### Genotyping
All DO mice were genotyped as described in Svenson \textit{et al.} (2012)
\citep{Svenson:2012hq} using the Mouse Universal Genotyping Array 
(MUGA) (7854 markers), and the MegaMUGA (77,642 markers) 
(GeneSeek, Lincoln, NE). All animal procedures were approved by the 
Animal Care and Use Committee at The Jackson Laboratory (Animal Use 
Summary \# 06006).

Founder haplotypes were inferred from SNPs using a Hidden Markov Model 
as described in Gattie \textit{et al.} (2014) \citep{Gatti:2014ko}. 
The MUGA and MegaMUGA arrays were merged to create a final set of 
evenly spaced 64,000 interpolated markers. 

### Tissue collection and gene expression
At euthenasia, whole livers were collected and gene expression was
measured using RNA-Seq as described perviously \citep{pmid27309819, pmid28592500}. 
Briefly, hepatocyte RNA was isolated using the Trizol Plus 
RNA extraction kit (Life Technologies), and 100-bp single-end reads 
were generated on the Illumina HiSeq 2000.


## Data Processing

### Sequence processing

The raw sequencing data from both RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq were put through 
the quality control program FastQC (0.11.5), and duplicate sequences 
were removed before downstream analysis. 

### Transcript quantification
Transcript sequences were aligned to strain-specific 
pseudo-genomes \citep{pmid27309819}, which integrate SNPs and 
indels from each strain based on the GRCm38 mouse genome 
build. The B6 samples were aligned directly to the reference 
mouse genome. The pseudogenomes were created using g2gtools 
(http://churchill-lab.github.io/g2gtools/#overview). 
We used EMASE (https://github.com/churchill-lab/emase) 
\citep{pmid29444201} to quantify the gene expression counts 
and DESeq2 vst transformation \citep{love2014moderated} to 
normalize the gene expression data. We filtered out transcripts 
with less than 1 CPM in two or more replicates.

### ChIP-Seq quantification
We used MACS 1.4.2 \citep{pmid18798982} to identify peaks in the ChIP-Seq 
sequencing data, with a significance threshold of $p \leq 10^{-5}$. 
In order to compare peaks across strains, we converted the MACS output 
peak coordinates to common B6 coordinates using g2g tools 
(https://churchill-lab.github.io/g2gtools/). 

## Quantifying DNA methylation
RRBS data were processed using a bismark-based pipeline modified from 
\citep{pmid30348905}. The pipeline uses Trim Galore! 0.6.3 
(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) for QC, 
followed by the trimRRBSdiversityAdaptCustomers.py script from NuGen for 
trimming the diversity adapters. This script is available at:

All samples had comparable quality levels and no outstanding flags. 
Total number of reads was 45-90 million, with an average read length 
of about 50 bp. Quality scores were mostly above 30 (including error bars), 
with the average above 38. Duplication level was reduced to $<2$ for about 
95\% of the sequences. 

High quality reads were aligned to a custom strain pseudogenomes, using 
bowtie2 as implemented in Bismark 0.22 \citep{pmid21493656}. The pseudogenomes were
created by incorporating strain-specific SNPs and indels into the reference 
genome using g2gtools (https://github.com/churchill-lab/g2gtools), allowing 
a more precise characterization of methylation patterns. Bismark methylation 
extractor tool was then used for creating a bed file of estimated methylation 
proportions for each animal, which was then translated to the reference mouse 
genome (GRCm38) coordinates using g2gtools. Unlike other liftover tools, 
g2gtools does not throw away alignments that land on indel regions. B6 samples 
were aligned directly to the reference mouse genome (mm10).

## Analysis of histone modifications

### Identification of chromatin states
We used ChromHMM (1.22) \citep{pmid29120462} to identify 
chromatin states, which are unique combinations of the four 
chromatin modifications, for example, one state could consist 
of high levels of both H3K4me3 and H3K4me1, and low levels 
of the other two modifications. We conducted all subsequent 
analyses at the level of the chromatin state. 

Prior to running ChromHMM, we converted the bam files that had
been aligned to the B6 genome as described above to bed files
using the bedtools function bamtobed \citep{quinlan2010bedtools}.
We then binarized the bed files using the BinarizeBed function
in ChromHMM with default parameters. 

We calculated chromatin states for all numbers of states between 
four and 16, which is the maximum number of states possible with four 
binary chromatin modifications ($2^n$). We ran all mouse strains
together in the same model as if they were different cell types
in a standard run of ChromHMM.

To ensure we were analyzing the most biologically meaningful chromatin 
states, we aligned states across all models of four to 16 states 
by assigning each to one of the sixteen possible binary states using an 
emissions probability of 0.3 as the threshold for presence/absence of the
histone mark. This threshold was used for comparison purposes only, and 
produced the most stable state estimates between models. We then 
investigated the stability of three features across all states: the 
emissions probabilities (Supp Fig1), the abundance of each 
state across transcribed genes (Supp Fig2), and the effect of each state 
on transcription (Supp Fig3). Methods for each of these analyses are 
described separately below. All measures were remarkably consistent across
all models, but the `r num.states`-state model was characterized by a wide
range of relatively abundant states with relatively strong effects on 
expression. We used this model for all subsequent analyses. For more 
details on how the different models were compared, see Supplemental Methods.

### Genome distribution of chromatin states

We investigated genomic distributions of chromatin states in two ways.
First, we used the ChromHMM function OverlapEnrichment to calculate 
enrichment of each state around known functional elements in the mouse 
genome. We analyzed the following features:

* Predicted Liver Chromatin States - We downloaded predicted liver 
chromatin states through the UCSC genome browser on February 14, 2023 
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables). We selected Expression 
and Regulation -> Chromatin State -> cHMM liver P0 (encode3RenChromHmmLiverP0) 
under the mouse mm10 assembly. These data include chromatin state 
annotations for mouse liver on post-natal day 0. The annotations 
were based on ChIP-Seq measurements of eight histone modifications: 
H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K4me2, H3K4me1, H3K9me3, H3K9ac, and 
H3K36me3. ChromHMM was used to identify 15 chromatin states that were 
each annotated with a putative function based in the literature.

* CpG Islands - Annotations of CpG islands in the mouse genome were included 
with the release of ChromHMM.

* Intergenic - Annotations of intergenic regions in the mouse genome were
included with the release of ChromHMM.

In addition to these enrichments around individual elements, we also calculated 
chromatin state abundance relative to the main anatomical features of a gene.
For each transcribed gene, we normalized the base pair positions to the length
of the gene such that the transcription start site (TSS) was fixed at 0, and the
transcription end site (TES) was fixed at 1. We also included 1000 bp upstream of 
the TSS and 1000 bp downstream of the TES, which were converted to values below 0 
and above 1 respectively. To map chromatin states to the normalized positions, 
we binned the normalized positions into bins of relative position incremented
by 0.1 and encompassing all upstream and downstream positions originally defined
as 1kb up and downstream of the gene body. If a bin encompassed multiple positions 
in the gene, we assigned the mean value of the feature of interest to the bin. To 
avoid potential contamination from regulatory regions of nearby genes, we only 
included genes that were at least 2kb from their nearest neighbor, for a final 
set of 14,048 genes.

### Chromatin state and gene expression

We calculated the effect of each chromatin state on gene expression 
(Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}C). We did this both across genes
and across strains. The across-gene analysis identified states that 
are associated with high expression and low expression within the 
hepatocytes. The across-strain analysis investigated whether 
variation in chromatin state across strains contributed to variation 
in gene expression across strains. 

For each transcribed gene, we calculated the proportion of the gene 
body that was assigned to each chromatin state. We then fit a linear 
model separately for each state to calculate the effect of state 
proportion with gene expression:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:model}
y_{e} = \beta x_{s} + \epsilon
\end{equation}

where $y_{e}$ is the rank normal scores \citep{conover1999practical} of the full 
transcriptome in a single inbred strain, and $x_{s}$ is the rank normal
proportion of each gene that was assigned to state $s$. We fit this model 
for each strain and each state to yield one $\beta$ coefficient with a 95\% 
confidence interval. We fit the strains independently to better identify
variation in chromatin state effects across strains. However, the effects 
were not different across strains (ANOVA $p > 0.5$), so we averaged the 
effects and confidence intervals across strains to yield one summary effect 
for each state. We further fit models for each state independently, rather
than using multiple regression, because we were primarily interested in the
marginal effects of each state for this study.

To calculate the effect of each chromatin state across strains, we first 
standardized transcript abundance across strains for each transcript. We 
also standardized the proportion of each chromatin state for each gene 
across strains. We then fit the same linear model, where $y_{e}$ was a 
rank normal vector concatenating all standardized expression levels 
across all strains, and $x_{s}$ was a rank normal vector concatenating 
all standardized state proportions across all strains. We fit the model for 
each state independently yielding a $\beta$ coefficient and 95\% confidence 
interval for each state. 

In addition to calculating the effect of state proportion across the full 
gene body, we also performed the same calculations in a position-based 
manner (Figure \ref{fig:state_effects}). To do this, we first normalized
the genomic positions of all chromatin states to run between 0 at the
transcription start site (TSS) and 1 at the transcription end site (TES)
of the local gene regardless of the DNA strand on which the gene was
encoded. Positions upstream of the TSS were assigned negative values and 
positions downstream of the TES were assigned values greater than 1. 
We then binned the normalized values into 42 evenly sized bins between 
-0.5 and 1.5. This number of bins provided good resolution around the 
points 0 and 1. In dividing chromatin state values into bins, we averaged 
all positions for each state that were contained in each bin. We fit the 
linear model described above for each positional bin thus creating 
position-based effect sizes for chromatin state on gene expression 
across genes and across strains.


## Analysis of DNA methylation

### Creation of DNA methylome
We combined the DNA methylation data into a single methylome cataloging
all unique methylated sites across all strains. For each site, we averaged 
the percent methylation across the three replicates in each strain. The final
methylome contained 5,311,670 unique sites across the genome. Because 
methylated CpG sites can be fully methylated, unmethylated, or 
hemi-methylated, we rounded the average percent methylation at each site 
to the nearest 0, 50, or 100\%.

### Decomposition of DNA methylome
To calculate the DNA methylation similarity across individuals 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:pc_plots}B we used the subset of the 
CpG sites that were shared across all strains at each B6 reference 
position. The resulting matrix contained individual mice in columns 
and shared methylation sites in rows. Each cell contained the measured 
level of DNA methylation at that position. We performed principal 
components analysis on this matrix.

### Strain-specific CpG sites
In addition to the analysis of CpG sites that were shared across
genes, we analyzed CpG sites that were strain-specific. We defined
a strain-specific CpG site as one that was present in all members
of at least one strain and absent in all members of at least one
other strain. 

### Distribution and methylation of CpG sites
We used the enrichment function in ChromHMM described above to identify 
enrichment of CpG sites around functional elements (e.g. CpG islands, 
mouse liver enhancers, and mouse liver promoters). These features 
are described above in the section "Genome distribution of 
chromatin states." We further performed position-based analyses
of both CpG density and percent methylation similar to the 
position-based abundance analyses performed for chromatin states.

To calculate overall CpG density relative to gene bodies, we 
calculated the inverse of the inter-CpG base pair distances within 
1kb of each expressed gene. We then normalized the position of 
each CpG to reflect its position relative to the gene's TSS 
(at 0) and its TES (at 1) as described above. We took the average 
of these values in each of 42 bins running from a relative position 
of -0.5 to 1.5 Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}C shows the average 
inverse inter-CpG distance across all 42 bins. CpG sites are 
most densely packed near the TSS (relative gene position = 0)
as expected. 

Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}D shows the average percent 
methylation in each of these bins, which was calculated in the 
same manner as above but we calculated the median percent methylation
in each bin rather than the inverse inter-CpG distance. The figure 
shows that CpG sites tend to be unmethylated near the TSS as expected.

### Association of DNA methylation with gene expression
As with chromatin state, we assessed the effect of DNA methylation 
on gene expression both across genes 
(Figure \ref{fig:DNA_methylation_effect}A) and across strains 
(Figure \ref{fig:DNA_methylation_effect}B). As with chromatin state,
we binned the normalized CpG positions into 42 bins running from just
upstream of the TSS to just downstream of the TES. We treated missing
CpG sites in individual strains as unmethylated, as it is uncommon
for non-CpG sites to be methylated. This allowed us to test strain-specific
CpG sites and variation in DNA methylation percent simultaneously. We 
then fit the linear model shown in equation 1 where $x_{s}$ was the 
rank Z normalized percent methylation either across genes or across 
strains in each position bin. Because the effect of DNA methylation 
on gene expression is well-known to be dependent on position, we only 
calculated a position-dependent effect on expression. We did not 
calculate the effect of percent methylation across the full gene on 
expression.

### Interactions between chromatin state and DNA methylation
We repeated the above analyses for DNA methylation conditioned
on each of the `r num.states` chromatin states. To do this, we 
isolated all CpG sites that were contained in the genomic regions 
defined by each chromatin state. We then performed the above analysis 
on each subset of CpG sites independently.

## Imputation of genomic features in Diversity Outbred mice
To assess the extent to which chromatin state and DNA methylation 
were associated with local expression QTLs, we imputed local 
chromatin state and DNA methylation into the population of 
diversity outbred (DO) mice. We compared the effect of the imputed 
epigenetic features to imputed SNPs and to local haplotype effects
as measured in the DO.

All imputations followed the same basic procedure: For each transcript, 
we identified the haplotype probabilities in the DO mice at the genetic 
marker nearest the gene transcription start site. This matrix held DO 
individuals in rows and DO founder haplotypes in columns 
(Supp. Fig. \ref{supp_fig:imputation}).

For each transcript, we also generated a three-dimensional array 
representing the genomic features (chromatin state, DNA methylation 
status, or SNP genotype) derived from the DO founders. This array 
held DO founders in rows, feature state in columns, and genomic 
position in the third dimension. The feature state for chromatin 
consisted of states one through `r num.states`, for SNPs feature state 
consisted of the genotypes A,C,G, and T.

We then multiplied the haplotype probabilities by each genomic feature 
array to obtain the imputed genomic feature for each DO mouse. This final 
array held DO individuals in rows, the genomic feature in the second 
dimension, and genomic position in the third dimension 
(Supp. Fig. \ref{supp_fig:imputation}). This array is analagous to the 
genoprobs object in R/qtl2 \citep{pmid30591514}. The genomic 
position dimension included all positions from 1 kb upstream of the 
TSS to 1 kb downstream of the TES for the given transcript. SNP data 
for the DO founders in mm10 coordinates were downloaded from the Sanger 
SNP database \citep{keane2011mouse} on July 6, 2021.

To calculate the effect of each imputed genomic feature on gene 
expression in the DO population, we fit a linear model 
$y_{e} = \beta x_{s} + \epsilon$ where $y_{e}$ was DO gene 
expression of a single transcript, and $x_{s}$ was the 
imputed level of a single chromatin state at a single base 
pair position within the encoding gene of the transcript. 
Prior to fitting this model, we regressed sex and DO generation 
out from all variables so that they would not be included in the
estimate of variance explained by each chromatin state.

Testing each state seprately is a bit artificial, since no single 
haplotype will explain as much variance as using all haplotypes 
together. However, it was critical in this study to maintain a 
single degree of freedom across all features so that we could
compare them. Otherwise haplotypes have seven degrees of freedom 
(df) at each location, chromatin states potentially have 13 df, 
although in practice typically have between two and four df, and 
both SNPs and DNA methylation have only one df. Thus, to compare 
the features, we tested only a single state at a time. From these 
linear models, we calculated the variance explained ($R^2$) by 
each genomic feature at each position (Figure \ref{fig:effect_distrubutions}), 
thereby relating gene expression in the DO to each position of 
the imputed feature in and around the gene body. We also kept 
the $\beta$ coefficients to identify overall trends in positive 
or negative effects on gene expression for each genomic feature 
at each position (Figure \ref{fig:state_effects}C).

### Permutations

Because any feature imputed from haplotype will be correlated with 
any feature that haplotype is correlated with, we performed 
permutations of the above statistics to assess whether each genomic 
feature was significantly correlated with gene expression beyond the 
effect of the imputation itself. To do the permutations, we shuffled 
the strain labels on each genomic feature vector (chromatin states, 
DNA methylation percent, or SNPs). This randomized the association 
between haplotype and the assigned genomic feature while preserving 
the association between haplotype and gene expression. We then 
re-imputed the permuted features into the DO and performed the 
association tests on the randomized imputed values as described above. 

We performed 1000 permutations for each transcript retaining the
$R^2$ value from each perutation. We then calculated an empirical 
$p$-value for the $R^2$ of each transcript based on these permutations. 
This was the number of times the permutations met or exceeded the 
observed $R^2$ value divided by the total number of permutations.
We then analyzed the empirical $p$-value distributions for uniformity.
A uniform $p$-value distribution across the transcripts would suggest 
that the given genomic feature was not significantly associated with 
gene expression. An enrichment of small $p$-values, on the other hand, 
would suggest that there is a significant association between the imputed 
genomic feature and gene expression beyond that conferred by the imputation 
itself. The $p$-value distributions for all three genomic features were 
highly enriched for small $p$-values (all Kruskal-Wallis $p < 2^{-16}$), 
suggesting that, although many individual imputed values were not significantly 
associated with gene expression, overall each genomic feature could 
be significantly associated with gene expression (Supplemental Figure XXX).

\caption{Comparison of emissions probabilities across all ChromHMM models.
Each row contains data for a single ChromHMM model fit to the number of
states indicated on either side of the row. Each set of four columns shows
data for each of the four histone modifications. Each set is separated from
the next by a column of gray for ease of visualization. The bottom row, the
reference row, shows the ideal state that all model states are being compared
to. Blue indicates absence of the histone mark and red indicates presence.
For each ChromHMM model, each state was assigned to one of the reference states
using an emissions probability of 0.3 as a threshold for presence of the histone
modification. If a state was not present in the given model, the corresponding
area is shown in gray. Emissions probabilities near 0 are shown in blue, and 
probabilities near 1 are shown in red. Orange and yellow indicate intermediate
probabilities. Aligning the states across all models shows a remarkable 
stability in the emissions across models, seen as vertical bars of consistent 
color.}
