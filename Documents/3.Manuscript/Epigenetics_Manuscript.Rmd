# Abstract
It is well known that epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications,
and DNA methylation are a major mode of regulating gene transcription.

It is not well known how variation in epigenetic modifications across
genetically distinct individuals contributes to heritable variation
in gene expression. 

When we map an eQTL, how much of the effect of the eQTL is mediated
through epigenetic modifications?

We investigated this question in genetically diverse mice. 

local imputed histone modifications matched eQTL extremely well, suggesting
that a large portion of variation in gene expression mapped to local genotype 
is mediated through histone modifications.

In contrast percent DNA methylation is not determined by local genetics, 
and does not contribute to eQTLs.


# Introduction

It is well known that epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications,
and DNA methylation are a major mode of regulating gene transcription.

It is not well known how variation in epigenetic modifications across
genetically distinct individuals contributes to heritable variation
in gene expression. 

When we map an eQTL, how much of the effect of the eQTL is mediated
through epigenetic modifications?

We investigated this question in genetically diverse mice. 

We conducted a survey of four histone modifications known to be correlated
with gene transcription across nine inbred strains of mice. We also 
surveyed DNA methylation in these strains. 

We looked at how both histone modifications and DNA methylation were 
associated with transcription variation across strains. We further 
imputed epigenetic states in a population of diversity outbred mice
to more directly investigate the extent to which eQTLs are driven by
variation in epigenetic modifications

histone modifications, at least early in life, are determined by local
genotype.




GWAS hits tend to be in non-coding regions of the genome
estimated that most common disease variants work by altering gene expression
rather than protein function

These disease-associated SNPs likely fall into functional regions of the
genome 

eQTLs - what are we measuring when we measure eQTL?

The identity of a hepatocyte is deterimined through patterns of gene 
expression. Patterns of gene expression are determined in part through 
patterns of genotype, DNA methylation, and chromatin modifications. 

Within a given cell type, how do variations in local genetics and 
epigenetics influence gene expression?

Across mouse strains, gene expression in hepatocytes is largely
similar. For the most part, genes that are highly expressed in one
strain are highly expressed in another. However, there are subtle 
variations in gene expression that are based on strain background. 

This variation in gene expression across strains is related to 
genetic and epigenetic factors. Here we explore how local genotype,
chromatin modifications, and DNA methylation influence strain
differences in gene expression. 

patterns of chromatin state in hepatocytes varied across strains
patterns of DNA methylation in hepatocytes varied across strains
patterns of gene expression in hepatocytes varied across strains

major axes of variation were similar in all cases, i.e. PWK and CAST were 
  most divergent, while other strains clustered together

Each of these epigenetic-expression patterns represent functioning 
hepatocytes these are "good enough" solutions to make hepatocytes 
[22859671]

There is evidence that, especially early in life, 
chromatin modifications are genetically determined [cite]. 

# Materials and Methods

## Mice

### Inbred Founder Mice

### Diversity Outbred mice
The genomic features we collected from inbred founders: chromatin state,
percent DNA methylation, and SNPs were imputed into a population of DO
mice based on local haplotypes. These mice were described previously in 
(Svenson 2012). The study population included males and females from DO 
generations four through eleven. Mice were randomly assigned to either a 
chow diet (6% fat by weight, LabDiet 5K52, LabDiet, Scott Distributing, 
Hudson, NH), or a high-fat, high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet (45\% fat, 40\% 
carbohydrates, and 15\% protein) (Envigo Teklad TD.08811, Envigo, Madison, 
WI). Mice were maintained on this diet for 26 weeks (CITE). 

## Genotyping

### Diversity outbred mice
All DO mice were genotyped as described in Svenson et al. (2012) using the Mouse 
Universal Genotyping Array (MUGA) (7854 markers), and the MegaMUGA (77,642 markers) 
(GeneSeek, Lincoln, NE). All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care 
and Use Committee at The Jackson Laboratory (Animal Use Summary # 06006). 

## Measurement of gene expression

### Inbred Founders

### Diversity outbred mice
At sacrifice, whole livers were collected and gene expression was measured using 
RNA-Seq as described in (Chick, Munger et al. 2016, and Tyler et al. 2017). 
The primary axes of variation in global gene expression grouped individuals 
from inbred strains together (Supplemental Figure XXX), indicating high 
replicability of gene expression measurements within each strain, and 

## Measurement of Chromatin Modifications

## Measurement of DNA Methylation
Percent DNA methylation was measured using reduced representation 
bisulfite sequencing. 

## Data Processing

## Normalization of RNA-Seq data

We remove transcripts with extremely low read counts, we 
filtered to those with a mean read count of at least five 
across all individuals. 

We then used the R package sva [sva] to perform a variance stabilizing 
transformation (vst) on the RNA-Seq read counts from both inbred
and outbred mice. In the inbred mice we used a blind transformation,
while in the outbred mice, we included DO wave and sex in the model.
For eQTL mapping, we performed rankZ normalization on the RNA-Seq read 
counts across transcripts from the outbred mice.

## Analysis

## Characterizing the landscape of gene expression across inbred strains
Using the variance-stabilized read counts in the inbred strains, we
calculated the standard deviation in expression across strains. We then
binned the genes into 15 bins with increasing standard deviation. We used
the R package gprofiler [CITE] to identify functional enrichments for each
bin. We defined the divergence in expression across strains as the F statistic
from an ANOVA testing the effect of strain on mean expression.


For each group of genes binned by standard deviation,
we performed singular value decomposition on the mean-centered expression
matrix. We then calculated the separation of the strains in the two-dimensional
space defined by the first two principle components. 

## Identification and characterization of chromatin states
We used ChromHMM [29120462] to identify chromatin states corresponding 
to the presence and absence of the four chromatin modifications. We calculated
states for all numbers of states between four and 16, which is the maximum
number of states possible with four binary chromatin modifications. 

### Selecting the number of chromatin states

To identify the ChromHMM model that corresponded best with gene 
expression, we compared the correlation of each state with gene 
expression across all ChromHMM models (Supp Fig. XXX). 
Across all models, the correlations between gene expression and 
chromatin state could be binned roughly into five bins: low, 
moderately low, no correlation, moderately high correlation, and 
high correlation. The nine-state model had states in each of these 
categories with the lowest redundancy. Furthermore, state seven in 
the nine-state model had the maximum correlation with gene expression. 
Therefore, we chose the nine-state model for downstream analysis.

### Chromatin state composition

Emissions probabilities derived from ChromHMM indicate the contribution
of each histone modification to each chromatin state (Figure XXX).

### Positional enrichments of chromatin states

We used the ChromHMM function OverlapEnrichment to identify correlations
between chromatin state position and annotated functional elements of the
genome. We used functional annotations for the following features:

* **Transcription start sites (TSS)** - Annotations of TSS in the mouse genome
were provided by RefSeq [26553804] and included with the release of ChromHMM, 
which we downloaded on December 9, 2019 [29120462].
* **Transcription end sites (TES)** - Annotations of TES in the mouse genome
were provided by RefSeq and included with the release of ChromHMM.
* **Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)** - We downloaded TFBS coordinates
from OregAnno [26578589] using the UCSC genome browser [12045153] on May 4, 2021.
* **Promoters** - We downloaded promoter coordinates provided by the eukaryotic
promoter database [27899657,25378343], through the UCSC genome browser on April
26, 2021.
* **Enhancers** - We downloaded annotated enhancers provided by ChromHMM through
the UCSC genome browser on April 26, 2021.
* **Candidates of cis regulatory elements in the mouse genome (cCREs)** - We 
downloaded cCRE annotations provided by ENCODE [22955616] through the UCSC genome 
browser on April 26, 2021.
* **CpG Islands** - Annotations of CpG islands in the mouse genome were included 
with the release of ChromHMM.

## Downloading SNP data
We downloaded SNP data for the eight inbred DO/CC founders from 
the Sanger SNP database [1921910, 21921916] on July 6, 2021.
We downloaded SNPs ranging from 1kb upstream of the TSS to 
1kb downstream of the TES for each gene in our expression data 
set.

## Aligning positions relative to gene bodies
For multiple analyses in this paper, we quantified genomic feature 
abundance or correlation to gene expression, based on the feature's
relative position to the gene body. To do this, we normalized all
gene coordinates to run from 0 at the transcription start site to 
1 at the transcription end site. Upstream regulatory regions were 
assigned negative coordinates and downstream regulatory regions were 
assigned coordinates greater than 1. Base pair positions of genomic
features were first centered on the TSS by subtracting the base pair
position of the TSS. Centered positions were then divided by the 
length of the gene in base pairs, defined as the distancr from the 
gene TSS to the gene TES. These relative positions were grouped into 
41 positions defined by the sequence from -2 to 2 incremented by 0.1.
If multiple positions were grouped together, the mean value across 
positions was used. 

To avoid potential contamination from regulatory regions of nearby 
genes, we only included genes that were at least 2kb from their nearest 
neighbor, for a final set of 14048 genes.

## Assessing physical distributions of epigenetic modifications
We used the above normalized base pair positions to calculate 
the relative abundance of each chromatin state across all gene 
bodies. For each relative position, we calculated the proportion 
of genes that contained each chromatin state. 

We also calculated the median percent DNA methylation across all 
gene bodies at each normalized position. To calculate density of 
CpG sites, we first used absolute base pair positions to calculate
the distance from each CpG site to the next. We then normalized 
the positions relative to gene TSS and TES as described above.
The final result was a distance to the next CpG site in base pairs
for each normalized position across the gene bodies.

## Correlating genomic features with gene expression in inbred mice
We correlated both chromatin state and percent DNA methylation with 
gene expression in nine strains of inbred mice which included the DO/CC
founders and DBA/2J. We looked for relationships between epigenetic 
features and gene expression both within-strain, and across strains.

Within-strain correlations between epigenetic features and gene 
expression suggest some role for the epigenetic feature in regulation
of expression. Across-strain correlations of epigenetic features and
gene expression further suggest a role for local genotype in determining
the regulatory epigenetic features. 

To assess the within-strain relationship between chromatin state and
gene expression, we scaled transcript levels of all genes in each strain.
We used the normalized base pair positions calculated above to average 
expression of all genes assigned to each chromatin state at each position
along the gene body.

Similarly, we calculated the correlation between gene expression and 
percent methylation at each normalized position across the gene body.

To identify across-strain correlations between epigenetic modifications
and transcript abundance, we scaled transcript abundance across strains
separately for each transcript. We then correlated this scaled abundance
with either chromatin state or percent DNA methylation at each normalized
position across the gene body.

## Imputing genomic features in Diversity Outbred mice

To further investigate the effect of genetic and epigenetic features 
on local gene expression, we imputed chromatin state, SNPs, and DNA 
methylation into a population of diversity outbred (DO) mice (CITE). 

Each imputation followed the same basic procedure: For each transcript, 
we identified the haplotype probabilities in the DO mice at the genetic 
marker nearest the gene transcription start site. This matrix held DO 
individuals in rows and DO founder haplotypes in columns.

For each transcript, we also generated a three-dimensional array representing 
the genomic features derived from the DO founders. This array held DO founders
in rows, feature state in columns, and genomic position in the third dimension. 
The feature state for chromatin consisted of states one through nine, for SNPs 
feature state consisted of the genotypes A,C,G, and T, and for DNA methylation, 
feature state consisted of percent DNA methylation rounded to the nearest 0\%, 
50\%, or 100\%. Rounding reduced the direct transfer of haplotype effects to 
functionally irrelevant variation in DNA methylation across strains at individual
positions.

We then matrix multiplied the haplotype probabilities by each genomic feature
array to obtain the imputed genomic feature for each DO mouse. This final array 
held DO individuals in rows, genomic feature in the second dimension, and genomic 
position in the third dimension. This array is analagous to the genoprobs object 
in R/qtl2 (CITE). The genomic position dimension included all positions between
the transcription start site and the transcription end site ($\pm 1kb$). SNP data 
for the DO founders in mm10 coordinates were downloaded from the Sanger SNP database 
(CITE), on July 6, 2021.

To calculate the effect of each genomic feature on gene expression, we 
fit the following linear model:

\begin{equation*}
y=\beta_0
\end{equation*}

where blah blah blah

From this linear model, we calculated the variance explained ($R^2$) by 
each genomic feature. We thus related gene expression in the DO to each 
position of imputed chromatin state, SNPs, or DNA methylation in 
and around the gene body. 

# Results

## The landscape of gene expression was strain-dependent

Across the inbred strains, the landscape of variation in gene expression 
was highly strain-dependent (Figure XXX). Principal components analysis
Expression in the wild-derived CAST and PWK strains diverged most strongly 
from the overall mean expression, and expression within each strain was 
highly replicable.

There was also a wide range of strain-specificity across individual 
transcripts (Figure XXX). Gene expression ranged from being highly
conserved across strains to highly divergent (Figure XXX). Transcripts
with the lowest variation across strains were enriched for basic cellular 
processes: RNA processing, chromatin modification, and chromosome organization.
Transcripts with the greatest variation across strains were enriched in 
hepatocyte-specific functions: steroid metabolism, small molecule biosynthesis, 
and lipid metabolism (Fig. XXX?)


## Nine chromatin states correspond to known functional elements

We identified nine chromatin states corresponding to nine distinct 
combinations of histone modifications (Figure XXXA). To annotate these
states to functional elements, we combined the following layers of information:

1. Histone mark combinations and previous findings in the literature.
2. Enrichments in functionally annotated regions in the mouse genome.
3. Effect on gene expression.


## Gene transcription start sites were hypomethylated


## Chromatin state effects variation in gene expression across strains

Although individual chromatin states had large effects on gene expression
within each strain, it was not known whether these states contribute 
to variation in gene expression across strains. 

To investigate this, we normalized gene expression across strains and 
fit a linear model to identify the effect of each chromatin state at 
each position along the gene body to expression variation across strains.

Remarkably, each chromatin state had similar effects on across-strain 
gene expression as within-strain gene expression, suggesting that 
variation in chromatin state 

## Variation in expression in an outbred population maps to imputed chromatin state

To further investigate whether chromatin state contributes to transcriptional
variation across strains, we imputed local chromatin state into a population 
of diversity outbred mice (REF). 


These states
were differentially distributed near functionally annotated genomic
elements (Figure XXXB). For example, State 1, which corresponded to 
the absence of all four histone modifications, found mainly in 
intergenic regions. States 5 and 9 were enriched near enhancers and 
TES respectively. Finally, states 3 and 7 were highly enriched near 
the TSS and other functional elements that also occur near the TSS, 
such as cis-regulatory regions (cCREs), transcription factor binding 
sites (TFBS), and promoters.

A subset of the chromatin states was correlated with gene expression
across genes (Figure XXXC) in a manner that concorded with both their
histone modification profiles and their enrichments near functional genomic 
elements. For example, the histone modification H3K27me3 has been previously
shown to be associated with lower transcript abundance [CITE]. We found this
modification in both states 2 and 3 (Figure XXXA), which were both correlated 
with reduced transcription (Figure XXXC). State 3, furthermore, was enriched
near the TSS, promoters, TFBS, and other regulatory elements supporting a
possible role in transcriptional regulation. 

State 5 was characterized by the presence of two histone modifications 
previously associated with increased transcription: H3K27ac [CITE], and
H3K4me1 [CITE]. The enrichment of this state in enhancers coincides with
previous work showing the presence of these two modifications in active
enhancers [21106759, 21160473, 29273804], and supports the role of this
state in upregulation of gene transcription.

States 6 and 7 were also associated with increased transcription and
the presence of transcriptionally activating histone modifications. 
State 6 was modestly enriched in enhancers, while state 7 was enriched
not only in enhancers, but also stongly near the TSS and other associated
functional elements (Figure XXXB).

## Chromatin states and DNA methylation were differentially enriched around gene bodies

In addition to looking for enrichment of chromatin states near 
annotated functional elements, we also characterized the relative 
spatial distribution around gene bodies of both chromatin states 
and DNA methylation. To do this, we scaled base pair positions of
our measured genomic features to run between 0 at the TSS and 1 
at the TES of their containing gene (Methods) (Figure XXX). 

Each chromatin state had a characteristic distribution pattern
relative to gene bodies (Figure XXXA and B). For example, state 1
was strongly depleted near the TSS, indicating that this region
is commonly subject to chromatin modification. However, its
abundance increased steadily to a peak at the TES. In contrast,
state 7 was present in over 60\% of TSS, but decreased to almost 
0\% near the TES.

The remaining states were relatively low in abundance compared
to states 1 and 7, but also showed specific distributions relative
to the gene body. State 8, was depleted at the TSS, but enriched 
immediately downstream of the TSS. State 9 had slight enrichments 
immediately upstream of the TSS and immediately downstream of the TES. 
These patterns agree with the enrichments around functional genomic 
elements shown in Figure XXXB, and add interesting resolution around
both the TSS and TES.

DNA methylation also showed strong positional enrichments 
(Figure XXXC and D). Across all genes, the TSS had densely
packed CpG sites cytosines relative to the region between 
the TSS and TES (Figure XXXC). As expected, the median CpG site 
near TSS were consistently hypomethylated relative to the median 
CpG site in intergenic regions. CpG sites within the gene body 
were slightly hypermethylated compared to intergenic CpGs (Figure XXXD).

## Chromatin state but not DNA methylation correlated with gene expression across strains

To investigate whether the previously identified relationships between
epigenetic features and gene expression were related to local genotype,
we looked for correlations between gene expression and epigenetic
features for each transcript across all inbred strains. That is, for 
any given transcript, did variation in chromatin state or DNA methylation
across strains correlate with gene expression?

The relationship between gene expression and chromatin state 
across strains was nearly identical to the relationship within-strain, 
including the positional effects. States 3 and
9 had negative correlations with gene expression across strains that were
localized to the TSS. States 5 and 7 had strong positive correlations with
gene expression throughout the gene body, and states 1 and 2 had strong
negative correlations with gene expression throughout the gene body. 

In stark contrast, DNA methylation was completely uncorrelated with 
variation in gene expression across strains (Figure XXXB). This lack
of correlation is likely due to the low variability of percent methylation
across strains at any given position. Figure XXXC shows the standard
deviation in percent DNA methylation at normalized positions across
the gene body. It is strikingly low everywhere, with the standard deviation
being around 6%, which is likely below any biologically functional threshold.
The variation dips even lower, to around 4% at the TSS, indicating that for
the most part that DNA methylation does not vary across strains and is not 
contributing to strain difference in gene expression.  

## Imputed chromatin state was correlated with gene expression in DO mice

To further investigate the relationship between genotype, epigenetic 
features, and gene expression, we imputed chromatin state, DNA methylation,
and SNPs into a population of DO mice described previously [Svenson, Tyler]
(Methods). Gene expression was measured in whole livers in these mice
giving us the opportunity to explore the extent to which local chromatin 
state corresponded with varation in gene expression across individuals. 

In addition to chromatin state, we also imputed DNA methylation state 
and SNPs as comparators.

SNP imputation is almost certainly ground truth in the DO mice
is chromatin state is determined by (local?) genotype? how well does this predict
  gene expression in animals with mixed up genomes of multiple founders
DNA methylation probably not determined by local genetics
  gives lower bound on expectations for imputations if feature is not
  related to gene expression

We compared the percent variance explained by local haplotype to the 
maximum percent variance explained by local chromatin state, local percent
DNA methylation, and local SNPs for each transcript (Figure XXXA).

Overall, local haplotype explained the largest amount of variance
in gene expression ($R^2 = 0.31$). The variance explained by local
chromatin state was very highly correlated with that of haplotype
(Pearson $r = 0.95$) and also explained a relatively high proportion
of variation in gene expression ($R^2 = 0.28$). Individual SNPs were
less correlated with haplotype (Pearson $r = 0.69$), and explained
less overall variance in gene expression ($R^2 = 0.12$). DNA methylation,
which previous results suggest is not genetically determined, had the
lowest correlation with haplotype (Pearson $r = 0.55$) and explained 
the least variance in gene expression ($R^2 = 0.07$).

An example of how different functional genomic features are associated
with gene expression is shown in Figure XXX.

finding supports idea that chromatin state is defined by local genetics
imputed chromatin almost as good as measured haplotype in explaining variation
in gene expression, but with higher resolution 

that this worked in a population of genetically unique mice with completely
mixed up genomes speaks to just how much gene expression is determined by
local genetics.

Powerful observation that we can impute chromatin state in 500 DO mice 
from measuring chromatin state in a handful of inbred mice

Gives us higher resolution than haplotype, without the loss of explanatory
power we get from SNP analysis

haplotype includes all genetically determined functional elements in a 
relatively large region

SNPs do tag the haplotype, but are 


 Further,
because chromatin modifications are measured at extremely high density,
we can map high-density chromatin effects in the DO mice, which may help 
prioritize functional SNPs within gene bodies and in regulatory regions.

For example, Figure XXX shows chromatin states across the gene Irf5
in the inbred founders along with the LOD score and chromatin state
effects at each position along the gene body as calculated in the DO 
population. The LOD scores and allele effects highlight variation 
at the TSS, and at several internal positions in the gene as potentially
regulating gene expression. 

## DNA methylation varied across the gene body

In addition to chromatin state, we examined the distribution of DNA
methylation across the gene body, as well as the relationship between
DNA methylation and gene expression in both inbred mice and DO mice.

As expected, methylated cytosines were densely packed near the gene
TSS (Figure XXX). They were relatively sparse within the gene body,
and had intermediate spacing outside of gene bodies. 

Outside of gene bodies, percent methylation was measured at an average
of 50\%, whereas there was very low DNA methylation at the gene TSS 
(Figure XXX). Percent DNA methylation within gene bodies was higher 
than the surrounding intergenic spaces, reaching a maximum of around 80\% 
near the gene TES.

Within each strain, percent methylation at the gene TSS was slightly 
negatively correlated with gene expression (Pearson r for all strains 
was about -0.2). However, there was very little variation in DNA methylation
across strains, particularly at the TSS, and consequently, there was no
relationship between percent methylation and gene expression across strains.


# Discussion

imputation gives us a way to do a very limited, gene-based GWAS?
not good wording, but we can potentially increase the resolution 
right around gene bodies


The 
enrichment of these states in regulatory regions indicates the 
possibility that these states are used for regulating expression 
levels whereas states 7 and 3 at the transcription start site may
be primarily related to switching gene transcription on and off.

Haplotype and chromatin state represent broader regions of genome than SNPs 
and DNA methylation, which are measured at the base pair level. The measurements 
that represent larger regions of the genome are more predictive of local gene 
expression than the point-wise measurements. 

While local haplotype is the best predictor of gene expression, it has poor 
resolution. SNPs and DNA methylation have very high resolution, but are 
relatively poor predictors of gene expression. Chromatin state sits in the 
middle ground. It is almost as good a predictor of gene expression as haplotype,
but has resolution down to 200 base pairs, thus offering the potential for
dissecting mechanisms of local gene expression at a higher resolution than
is possible with haplotype alone. 

There is clearly a lot going on at the TSS, but there these results show 
correlations between gene expression 

Perhaps by overlaying all modalities, particularly with measurements of open
chromatin, we can come up with examples of this kind of inference? Are there 
any anecdotes that illustrate this?

Local chromatin state was highly correlated with local gene expression in the
DO/CC founders. This was true across genes within each strain, as well as 
for individual genes across strains, suggesting that variation in chromatin 
modifications may be a major mechanism of local gene expression regulation. 

(Alternatively, chromatin state aligns well with the true local mechanism of
gene regulation, but is not itself a mechanism.)

RRBS discussion - In humans estimates of heritability of DNA methylation are 
relatively low (0.1 to 0.3). It is estimated that around 10% of methylation 
sites are highly heritable. heritability estimates are age- and 
population-specific.

Even if there are inherited patterns of DNA methylation, do they have any
effect on gene expression? Keep in mind that we are only looking at local
effects.

human studies have shown that trimodal sites (0, 0.5, 1) have relatively 
high heritability (0.8), and almost half were associated with eQTLs.

no evidence for trans-generational inheritance of DNA methylation in 
humans.


## Positional information is interesting


We observed interesting spatial patterns of chromatin state distribution and

correlation with gene expression. States 3 and 7 were particularly abundant
around transcription start sites (TSS), while all other states were depleted 
at the TSS. State 8 peaked in abundance immediately downstream of the TSS, 
and state 9 peaked immediately upstream of the TSS. 

State 5 had relatively low abundance. However, it was concentrated within 
gene bodies where it had a relatively strong positive correlation with 
gene expression. This indicates that (?)
