There is evidence that, especially early in life, 
chromatin modifications are genetically determined [cite]. 

# Materials and Methods

## Mice

## Measurement of Chromatin Modifications

## Measurement of DNA Methylation
Percent DNA methylation was measured using reduced representation 
bisulfite sequencing. 

## Data Processing

## Identifying chromatin states
We used ChromHMM to identify chromatin states corresponding to the 
presence and absence of the four chromatin modifications. We calculated
states for all numbers of states between four and 16, which is the maximum
number of states possible with four binary chromatin modifications. 

## Aligning positions relative to gene bodies
For multiple analyses in this paper, we quantified genomic feature 
abundance or correlation to gene expression, based on the feature's
relative position to the gene body. To do this, we normalized all
gene coordinates to run from 0 at the transcription start site to 
1 at the transcription end site. Upstream regulatory regions were 
assigned negative coordinates and downstream regulatory regions were 
assigned coordinates greater than 1. Base pair positions of genomic
features were first centered on the TSS by subtracting the base pair
position of the TSS. Centered positions were then divided by the 
length of the gene in base pairs, defined as the distancr from the 
gene TSS to the gene TES. These relative positions were grouped into 
41 positions defined by the sequence from -2 to 2 incremented by 0.1.
If multiple positions were grouped together, the mean value across 
positions was used. 

To avoid potential contamination from regulatory regions of nearby 
genes, we only included genes that were at least 2kb from their nearest 
neighbor, for a final set of 14048 genes.

## Correlating genomic features with gene expression in DO founders
We correlated both chromatin state and percent DNA methylation with 
gene expression in the DO founders. 

### Chromatin State
To correlate chromatin state with gene expression, we calculated the
proportion of the gene body that was assigned to each chromatin state
across the nine inbred founders. We then correlated the proportion of
each state with the mean gene expression across the founders. We 
calculated these correlations across all states and all state models.

### DNA Methylation
To correlate percent DNA methylation with gene expression, 


## Assessing abundance of chromatin states across gene bodies
We calculated the relative abundance of each chromatin state
across all gene bodies. 

## Assessing correlation of chromatin state with expression across gene body
We used the normalized gene coordinates calculated above to calculate 
position-based correlations between chromatin state and gene expression.
To do this we used a sliding window across the gene body from normalized
coordinates -1 to +2 and correlated state proportion within each window
with gene expression.

## Imputing genomic features in Diversity Outbred mice

To further investigate the effect of genetic and epigenetic features on 
local gene expression, we imputed chromatin state, SNPs, and DNA methylation
into a population of diversity outbred (DO) mice (CITE). These mice, described
previously in (CITE), included males and females from DO generations four through
eleven. Mice were randomly assigned to either a chow diet (6% fat by weight, 
LabDiet 5K52, LabDiet, Scott Distributing, Hudson, NH), or a high-fat, high-sucrose 
(HF/HS) diet (45% fat, 40% carbohydrates, and 15% protein) (Envigo Teklad TD.08811, 
Envigo, Madison, WI). Mice were maintained on this diet for 26 weeks (CITE).

All mice were genotyped as described in Svenson et al. (2012) using the Mouse 
Universal Genotyping Array (MUGA) (7854 markers), and the MegaMUGA (77,642 markers) 
(GeneSeek, Lincoln, NE). All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care 
and Use Committee at The Jackson Laboratory (Animal Use Summary # 06006). 

Each imputation followed the same basic procedure: For each transcript, 
we identified the haplotype probabilities in the DO mice at the genetic marker 
nearest the gene transcription start site. This matrix held DO individuals in
rows and DO founder haplotypes in columns.

For each transcript, we also generated a three-dimensional array representing 
the genomic features derived from the DO founders. This array held DO founders
in rows, feature state in columns, and genomic position in the third dimension. 
The feature state for chromatin consisted of states one through nine, for SNPs 
feature state consisted of the genotypes A,C,G, and T, and for DNA methylation, 
feature state consisted of percent DNA methylation rounded to the nearest 0\%, 
50\%, or 100\%.

We then matrix multiplied the haplotype probabilities by each genomic feature
array to obtain the imputed genomic feature for each DO mouse. This final array 
held DO individuals in rows, genomic feature in the second dimension, and genomic 
position in the third dimension. This array analagous to the genoprobs object in 
R/qtl2 (CITE). The genomic position dimension included all positions between
the transcription start site and the transcription end site ($\pm 1kb$). SNP data 
for the DO founders in mm10 coordinates were downloaded from the Sanger SNP database 
(CITE), on July 6, 2021.

We used R/qtl2 [cite] to calculate the effect of each genomic feature on gene 
expression in the DO. We calculated LOD scores to relate gene expression in the
DO to each position with imputed chromatin state, SNPs, or DNA methylation in 
and around the gene body. 

# Results

## Chromatin State and Gene Expression

### The nine-state model had the highest correlation with gene expression

To identify the ChromHMM model that corresponded best with gene 
expression, we compared the correlation of each state with gene 
expression (Methods) across all ChromHMM models (Supp Fig. XXX). 
Across all models, the correlations between gene expression and 
chromatin state could be binned roughly into five bins: low, 
moderately low, no correlation, moderately high correlation, and 
high correlation. The nine-state model had states in each of these 
categories with the lowest redundancy. Furthermore, state seven in 
the nine-state model had the maximum correlation with gene expression. 
Therefore, we chose the nine-state model for downstream analysis.

### Genomic position enrichments aided interpretation of chromatin states

The correlation between chromatin state and gene expression, as well as
positional enrichments around functionally annotated positions in the 
genome aided annotation of individual chromatin states. For example, 
chromatin state 5, which was characterized by the co-occurence of H3K27ac 
and H3K4me1, had enriched representation around known enhancers. 
Its presence was also positively correlated with gene expression. This
combination of chromatin modifications has previously been associated with 
active enhancers [21106759, 21160473, 29273804].

State 7, which was characterized by the presence of three activating
marks, H3k27ac, H3k4me1, and H3K4me3. It was enriched around 
transcription start sites (TSS) and promoters and was also positively 
correlated with gene expression. 

State 3 was characterized by the presence of H3K4me1 and H3k27me3. 
H3K27me3 is associated with downregulation of transcription and
poised enhancers. When paired with H3K4me1

also enriched around 
promoters and TSS, but was most strongly enriched at transcription 
factor binding sites, 

Table?? Figure?? Supp Figure??

### Promoter and enhancer states correlated with increased expression
Chromatin states 5 and 7, which were enriched around enhancers and promoters 
respectively, were correlated with increased expression. This was true
both across the liver transcriptome, as well as across strains. That is,
that within a single strain, genes with higher proportions of states 5 
or 7 across the gene body were more highly expressed than genes with 
low proportions of these states. And for individual genes, strains 
with higher proportions of states 5 and 7 had higher expression than 
strains with lower proportions of these states (Figure?).

State 6 was also correlated with increased gene expression to a lesser
degree. This state was also enriched at enhancers, though less so than 
state 5.

### H3K27me3 and the absence of measured marks correlated with decreased expression

High abundance of states 1, 2, and 3 were correlated with decreased 
gene expression. State 1 was the absence of all measured chromatin 
modifications, and states 2 and 3 were the only states with the 
suppressing modification H3K27me3. State 1 was enriched in intergenic 
regions and state 3 was enriched around transcription factor binding 
sites. Positional enrichment of state 2 was not clear.

### Differential spatial distribution of states around gene bodies
Chromatin states were each distributed in a specific pattern 
across gene bodies (Methods) (Figure XXX). For example, state 1
was strongly depleted near the TSS, indicating that this region
is commonly subject to chromatin modification. However, its
abundance increased steadily to a peak at the TES. In contrast,
state 7 was present in over 60\% of TSS, but decreased to almost 
0\% near the TES.

The remaining states were relatively low in abundance compared
to states 1 and 7, but also showed gene-body specific distribution
patterns. State 8, was depleted at the TSS, but enriched immediately
downstream of the TSS. State 9 had slight enrichments immediately 
upstream of the TSS and immediately downstream of the TES. The 
enrichment of these states in regulatory regions indicates the 
possibility that these states are used for regulating expression 
levels whereas states 7 and 3 at the transcription start site may
be primarily related to switching gene transcription on and off.

### Correlation of chromatin state and gene expression was differentially distributed across the gene body

We examined whether there was a spatial component to the correlation between
chromatin state and gene expression (Methods). 

Figure XXX shows the Pearson correlation between expression and chromatin 
state across all windows for each chromatin state. The most prominant
position-specific correlations between state and gene expression were
for state 3 and state 9, which were both negatively correlated with 
gene expression exclusively at the TSS. There were no TES-specific
correlations for any state. 

## Imputed chromatin state correlated with local gene expression in Diversity Outbred mice

We investigated the extent to which chromatin state imputed into DO mice 
explained variation in expression across individuals. Although local 
genetic variation explains a large amount of variation in gene 
expression [cite], chromatin state may offer further insight into 
regulation of gene expression at the local level. [more compelling stuff here]

We imputed genome-wide chromatin states in a population of DO mice based 
on their genotype (Methods) and compared the percent variance explained by
local genotype to the maximum percent variance explained by local chromatin 
state for each transcript (Figure XXX.) The two measurements were very 
tightly correlated (Pearson R = 0.95) indicating that chromatin state
determined by genetics is an excellent approximation of the genetic 
effect on gene expression. The imputation further allowed us to observe 
the effects of chromatin state across [500] genetically diverse mice
by measuring chromatin modifications in a handful of inbred mice. Further,
because chromatin modifications are measured at extremely high density,
we can map high-density chromatin effects in the DO mice, which may help 
prioritize functional SNPs within gene bodies and in regulatory regions.

For example, Figure XXX shows chromatin states across the gene Irf5
in the inbred founders along with the LOD score and chromatin state
effects at each position along the gene body as calculated in the DO 
population. The LOD scores and allele effects highlight variation 
at the TSS, and at several internal positions in the gene as potentially
regulating gene expression. 

## DNA methylation varied across the gene body

In addition to chromatin state, we examined the distribution of DNA
methylation across the gene body, as well as the relationship between
DNA methylation and gene expression in both inbred mice and DO mice.

As expected, methylated cytosines were densely packed near the gene
TSS (Figure XXX). They were relatively sparse within the gene body,
and had intermediate spacing outside of gene bodies. 

Outside of gene bodies, percent methylation was measured at an average
of 50\%, whereas there was very low DNA methylation at the gene TSS 
(Figure XXX). Percent DNA methylation within gene bodies was higher 
than the surrounding intergenic spaces, reaching a maximum of around 80\% 
near the gene TES.

Within each strain, percent methylation at the gene TSS was slightly 
negatively correlated with gene expression (Pearson r for all strains 
was about -0.2). However, there was very little variation in DNA methylation
across strains, particularly at the TSS, and consequently, there was no
relationship between percent methylation and gene expression across strains.


# Discussion
Local chromatin state was highly correlated with local gene expression in the
DO/CC founders. This was true across genes within each strain, as well as 
for individual genes across strains, suggesting that variation in chromatin 
modifications may be a major mechanism of local gene expression regulation. 

(Alternatively, chromatin state aligns well with the true local mechanism of
gene regulation, but is not itself a mechanism.)

The most abundant states were 7 and 1, followed by states 8, 9, and 3.
States 4, 5, and 6 were the lowest abundant states. Interestingly, 
despite its low abundance, state 5, which was concentrated within gene
bodies had a relatively strong positive correlation with gene expression
when present in this region, indicating that (?)

We observed interesting spatial patterns of chromatin state distribution and
correlation with gene expression. States 3 and 7 were particularly abundant
around transcription start sites (TSS), while all other states were depleted 
at the TSS. State 8 peaked in abundance immediately downstream of the TSS, 
and state 9 peaked immediately upstream of the TSS. 

State 5 was of lower abundance than the other states were concentrated within the gene body.



Haplotype and chromatin state represent broader regions of genome than SNPs 
and DNA methylation, which are measured at the base pair level. The measurements 
that represent larger regions of the genome are more predictive of local gene 
expression than the point-wise measurements.
