Figure XXX. Boxplots show the distribution of correlation between the proportion of each chromatin state and gene expression. States are shown along the x axis. The y axis shows the Pearson correlation between each chromatin state and gene expression.  Each point represents a single gene. The color of each point is based on the -log(p) of the correlation between the state proportion and transcription. On average, higher proportions of states 1 and 2 were correlated with lower expression, while higher proportions of states 5, 6, and 7 were associated with increased expression.

Supp. Fig XXX. Comparison of the correlation between state and gene expression across different ChromHMM models. Each point shows the median correlation between gene expression and the proportion of a single state. 
Color corresponds to the position on the y axis and aids in visualization. Median correlation values were relatively consistent across all models. However, the nine-state model had the highest overall correlation between state and gene expression. It also was the minimum number of states across the full range of correlations. It was the first state model to
