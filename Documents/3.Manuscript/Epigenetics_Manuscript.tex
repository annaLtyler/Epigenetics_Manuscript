\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

It is well known that epigenetic modifications, such as histone
modifications, and DNA methylation are a major mode of regulating gene
transcription.

It is not well known how variation in epigenetic modifications across
genetically distinct individuals contributes to heritable variation in
gene expression.

When we map an eQTL, how much of the effect of the eQTL is mediated
through epigenetic modifications?

We investigated this question in genetically diverse mice.

local imputed histone modifications matched eQTL extremely well,
suggesting that a large portion of variation in gene expression mapped
to local genotype is mediated through histone modifications.

In contrast percent DNA methylation is not determined by local genetics,
and does not contribute to eQTLs.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

It is well known that epigenetic modifications, such as histone
modifications, and DNA methylation are a major mode of regulating gene
transcription.

It is not well known how variation in epigenetic modifications across
genetically distinct individuals contributes to heritable variation in
gene expression.

When we map an eQTL, how much of the effect of the eQTL is mediated
through epigenetic modifications?

We investigated this question in genetically diverse mice.

We conducted a survey of four histone modifications known to be
correlated with gene transcription across nine inbred strains of mice.
We also surveyed DNA methylation in these strains.

We looked at how both histone modifications and DNA methylation were
associated with transcription variation across strains. We further
imputed epigenetic states in a population of diversity outbred mice to
more directly investigate the extent to which eQTLs are driven by
variation in epigenetic modifications

histone modifications, at least early in life, are determined by local
genotype.

DNA methylation is not determined genetically

GWAS hits tend to be in non-coding regions of the genome estimated that
most common disease variants work by altering gene expression rather
than protein function

These disease-associated SNPs likely fall into functional regions of the
genome

eQTLs - what are we measuring when we measure eQTL?

The identity of a hepatocyte is deterimined through patterns of gene
expression. Patterns of gene expression are determined in part through
patterns of genotype, DNA methylation, and chromatin modifications.

Within a given cell type, how do variations in local genetics and
epigenetics influence gene expression?

Across mouse strains, gene expression in hepatocytes is largely similar.
For the most part, genes that are highly expressed in one strain are
highly expressed in another. However, there are subtle variations in
gene expression that are based on strain background.

This variation in gene expression across strains is related to genetic
and epigenetic factors. Here we explore how local genotype, chromatin
modifications, and DNA methylation influence strain differences in gene
expression.

patterns of chromatin state in hepatocytes varied across strains
patterns of DNA methylation in hepatocytes varied across strains
patterns of gene expression in hepatocytes varied across strains

major axes of variation were similar in all cases, i.e.~PWK and CAST
were most divergent, while other strains clustered together

Each of these epigenetic-expression patterns represent functioning
hepatocytes these are ``good enough'' solutions to make hepatocytes
{[}22859671{]}

There is evidence that, especially early in life, chromatin
modifications are genetically determined {[}cite{]}.

The genomic features we collected from inbred founders: chromatin state,
percent DNA methylation, and SNPs were imputed into a population of DO
mice based on local haplotypes. These mice were described previously in
(Svenson 2012). The study population included males and females from DO
generations four through eleven. Mice were randomly assigned to either a
chow diet (6\% fat by weight, LabDiet 5K52, LabDiet, Scott Distributing,
Hudson, NH), or a high-fat, high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet (45\% fat, 40\%
carbohydrates, and 15\% protein) (Envigo Teklad TD.08811, Envigo,
Madison, WI). Mice were maintained on this diet for 26 weeks (CITE).

(MUGA) (7854 markers), and the MegaMUGA (77,642 markers) (GeneSeek,
Lincoln, NE). All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee at The Jackson Laboratory (Animal Use Summary \# 06006).

Founder haplotypes were inferred from SNPs using a Hidden Markov Model
as described in Gatti\textsubscript{\textit{et~al.}}2014. The MUGA and
MegaMUGA arrays were merged to create a final set of evenly spaced
64,000 interpolated markers.

We then used the R package sva \{{[}\}sva\{{]}\} to perform a variance
stabilizing transformation (vst) on the RNA-Seq read counts from both
inbred and outbred mice. In the inbred mice we used a blind

in the model. For eQTL mapping, we performed rank Z normalization on the
RNA-Seq read counts across transcripts from the outbred mice.

\hypertarget{identification-of-chromatin-states}{%
\subsubsection{Identification of chromatin
states}\label{identification-of-chromatin-states}}

We used ChromHMM {[}29120462{]} to identify \emph{chromatin states},
which are unique combinations of the four chromatin modifications, for
example, the presence of both H3K4me3 and H3K4me1, but the absence of
the other two modifications. We conducted all subsequent analyses at the
level of the chromatin state.

To ensure we were analyzing the most biologically meaningful chromatin
states, we calculated chromatin states for all numbers of states between
four and 16, which is the maximum number of states possible with four
binary chromatin modifications (\(2^n\)). We then investigated a number
of features of each state in each model: presence/absence of histone
modifications, distribution patterns across the genome, and the effect
of each state on gene expression. We compared chromatin states from the
different models based on these analyses and selected the 14-state
model. Each of these analyses, and the model comparison, are described
below.

\hypertarget{emission-probabilities}{%
\subsubsection{Emission probabilities}\label{emission-probabilities}}

Emission probabilites are a primary output of ChromHMM (Figure XXXA).
They define the probability that each histone mark is present in each
detected state. Low probabilities suggest absence, or low levels of the
mark, and high probabilities suggest presence. To compare states to each
other and to annotate states, we declared a histone mark to be present
in a state if its emission probability was 0.3 or higher.

\hypertarget{genome-distribution-of-chromatin-states}{%
\subsubsection{Genome distribution of chromatin
states}\label{genome-distribution-of-chromatin-states}}

We investigated genomic distributions of chromatin states in two ways.
First, we used the ChromHMM function OverlapEnrichment to calculate
enrichment of each state around known functional elements in the mouse
genome. We analyzed the following features:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Transcription start sites (TSS)} - Annotations of TSS in the
  mouse genome were provided by RefSeq {[}26553804{]} and included with
  the release of ChromHMM, which we downloaded on December 9, 2019
  {[}29120462{]}.
\item
  \textbf{Transcription end sites (TES)} - Annotations of TES in the
  mouse genome were provided by RefSeq and included with the release of
  ChromHMM.
\item
  \textbf{Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)} - We downloaded
  TFBS coordinates from OregAnno {[}26578589{]} using the UCSC genome
  browser {[}12045153{]} on May 4, 2021.
\item
  \textbf{Promoters} - We downloaded promoter coordinates provided by
  the eukaryotic promoter database {[}27899657,25378343{]}, through the
  UCSC genome browser on April 26, 2021.
\item
  \textbf{Enhancers} - We downloaded annotated enhancers provided by
  ChromHMM through the UCSC genome browser on April 26, 2021.
\item
  \textbf{Candidates of cis regulatory elements in the mouse genome
  (cCREs)} - We downloaded cCRE annotations provided by ENCODE
  {[}22955616{]} through the UCSC genome browser on April 26, 2021.
\item
  \textbf{CpG Islands} - Annotations of CpG islands in the mouse genome
  were included with the release of ChromHMM.
\end{itemize}

In addition to these enrichments around individual elements, we also
calculated chromatin state abundance relative to the main anatomical
features of a gene. For each transcribed gene, we generated a chromatin
state matrix with genomic position in rows, and mouse strains in
columns. Each cell contained the chromatin state assignment for a 200
base pair (bp) window, defined by ChromHMM, for each strain. We
normalized these bp positions for each gene, such that they ran from 0
at the transcription start site (TSS) to 1 at the transcription end site
(TES). We also included 1000 bp upstream of the TSS and 1000 bp
downstream of the TES, which were converted to values below 0 and above
1 respectively.

To normalize the coordinates, we first centered all coordinates on the
TSS of the gene by subtracting off the base pair position of the TSS.
Centered positions were then divided by the length of the gene in base
pairs from the TSS to the TES. We then binned the relative positions
into 41 bins defined by the sequence from -2 to 2 incremented by 0.1. If
a bin encompassed multiple positions in the gene, we assigned the mean
value of the feature of interest to the bin. To avoid potential
contamination from regulatory regions of nearby genes, we only included
genes that were at least 2kb from their nearest neighbor, for a final
set of 14048 genes.

\hypertarget{chromatin-state-and-gene-expression}{%
\subsubsection{Chromatin state and gene
expression}\label{chromatin-state-and-gene-expression}}

We calculated the effect of each chromatin state on gene expression. We
did this both across genes and across strains. The first analysis
identifies states that are associated with high expression and low
expression within the hepatocytes, and the second analysis investigates
whether variation in chromatin state across strains contributes to
variation in gene expression across strains.

For each transcribed gene, we calculated the proportion of the gene body
that was assigned to each chromatin state. We then fit a linear model
separately for each state to calculate the effect of state proportion
with gene expression:

\begin{equation*}{\label{eqn:chromatin_effect}}
y_{e} = \beta x_{s} + \epsilon
\end{equation*}

where \(y_{e}\) is the rank Z normalized gene expression of the full
transcriptome in a single inbred strain, and \(x_{s}\) is the rank Z
normalized proportion of each gene that was assigned to state \(s\). We
fit this model for each strain and each state to yield one \(\beta\)
coefficient with 95\% confidence interval. The effects were not
different across strains, so we averaged the effects and confidence
intervals across strains to yield one summary effect for each state.

To calculate the effect of each chromatin state across strains, we first
standardized transcript abundance across strains for each transcript. We
also standardized the proportion of each chromatin state for each gene
across strains. We then fit the same linear model, where \(y_{e}\) was a
rank Z normalized vector concatenating all standardized expression
levels across all strains, and \(x_{s}\) was a rank Z normalized vector
concatenating all standardized state proportions across all strains. We
fit the model for each state independently yielding a \(\beta\)
coefficient and 95\% confidence interval for each state.

In addition to calculating the effect of state proportion across the
full gene body, we also performed the same calculations in a
position-based manner. This second analysis yielded an effect of each
state at multiple points along the gene body and a more nuanced view of
the effect of each state.

\hypertarget{selecting-the-most-biologically-meaningful-model}{%
\subsubsection{Selecting the most biologically meaningful
model}\label{selecting-the-most-biologically-meaningful-model}}

We performed the above analyses on all states from the four-state model
to the 16-state model to find the most meaningful clustering of histone
modifications. Across all models, the states were remarkably stable
(Supplemental Figure XXX). As we increased the number of states detected
by the model, new states appeared, but previously detected states were
not disrupted. This stability was apparent in all state measures:
emissions probability patterns, overall abundance, effect on
expresssion, and localization along the genome. The one exception to
this stability was that highly abundant state (present in 65\% of
transcribed genes) detected first in the four-state model was split into
two distinct states in the 10-state model. These states were also highly
abundant (appearing in 40\% and 41\% of transcribed genes), and had
distinct genomic distributions and emissions probabilities (Supplemental
Figure XXX). These two states remained stable with increasing numbers of
clusters through to the 16-state model. States arising after the
10-state model were of lower abundance, appearing in 2\% or less of
transcribed genes.

All of the higher abundance states were established in the 10-state
model. However, as we moved toward higher numbers of clusters, the
resolution on the lower-abundance states improved in terms of the
emission probability profiles, and strength of the correlation with gene
expression. For example, the 14-state model better resolved a state that
had appeared in the 10-state model but was not strongly correlated with
gene expression. In the 14-state model, the emission patterns were
closer to binary, and the strength of the correlation with expression
was increased. Beyond 14 clusters, the new states identified were
extremely rare (1\% of transcripts or less), and were not strongly
correlated with gene expression. We thus selected the 14-state model and
the model with the most biologically meaningful clusters.

\hypertarget{analysis-of-dna-methylation}{%
\subsection{Analysis of DNA
methylation}\label{analysis-of-dna-methylation}}

\hypertarget{creation-of-dna-methylome}{%
\subsubsection{Creation of DNA
methylome}\label{creation-of-dna-methylome}}

We combined the DNA methylation data into a single methylome cataloging
the methylated sites across all strains. For each site, we averaged the
percent methylation across the three replicates in each strain. The
final methylome contained 5,311,670 unique sites across the genome.
Because methylated CpG sites can be fully methylated, unmethylated, or
hemi-methylated, we rounded the average percent methylation at each site
to the nearest 0, 50, or 100.

\hypertarget{distribution-of-cpg-sites}{%
\subsubsection{Distribution of CpG
sites}\label{distribution-of-cpg-sites}}

We used the enrichment function in ChromHMM described above to identify
enrichment of CpG sites around functional elements in the mouse genome.
We further performed a gene-based analysis of abundance similar to that
in the chromatin states. As a function of relative position on the gene
body, we calculated the density of CpG sites as the average distance to
the next downstream CpG site, as well as the percent methylation at each
site.

\hypertarget{effects-of-dna-methylation-on-gene-expression}{%
\subsubsection{Effects of DNA methylation on gene
expression}\label{effects-of-dna-methylation-on-gene-expression}}

As with chromatin state, we assessed the effect of DNA methylation on
gene expression both within strains (across genes), and across strains.
We used the same linear model described above, except that \(y_{s}\)
became the rank Z normalized percent methylation either across genes or
across strains. However, unlike with the chromatin states, we only
calculated the effects of DNA methylation on gene expression in a
position-dependent manner.

\hypertarget{imputation-of-genomic-features-in-diversity-outbred-mice}{%
\subsection{Imputation of genomic features in Diversity Outbred
mice}\label{imputation-of-genomic-features-in-diversity-outbred-mice}}

To assess the extent to which chromatin state and DNA methylation are
responsible for local expression QTLs, we imputed local chromatin state
and DNA methylation into a population of diversity outbred (DO) mice
described above and in Svenson et al.~2012. We compared the effect of
the imputed epigenetic features to imputed SNPs.

All imputations followed the same basic procedure: For each transcript,
we identified the haplotype probabilities in the DO mice at the genetic
marker nearest the gene transcription start site. This matrix held DO
individuals in rows and DO founder haplotypes in columns.

For each transcript, we also generated a three-dimensional array
representing the genomic features derived from the DO founders. This
array held DO founders in rows, feature state in columns, and genomic
position in the third dimension. The feature state for chromatin
consisted of states one through 14, for SNPs feature state consisted of
the genotypes A,C,G, and T (Fig XXX?).

We then multiplied the haplotype probabilities by each genomic feature
array to obtain the imputed genomic feature for each DO mouse. This
final array held DO individuals in rows, the genomic feature in the
second dimension, and genomic position in the third dimension. This
array is analagous to the genoprobs object in R/qtl2 (CITE). The genomic
position dimension included all positions from 1 kb upstream of the TSS
to 1 kb downstream of the TES. SNP data for the DO founders in mm10
coordinates were downloaded from the Sanger SNP database {[}1921910,
21921916{]}, on July 6, 2021.

To calculate the effect of each imputed genomic feature on gene
expression in the DO population, we fit a linear model. From this linear
model, we calculated the variance explained (\(R^2\)) by each genomic
feature, thereby relating gene expression in the DO to each position of
the imputed feature in and around the gene body.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

Gene expression varies widely and reproducibly across inbred strains of
mice (Figure XXX). Genetic control of this variation can be measured in
a mapping population as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), which
associate genetic variation with this variation in gene expression. In
this study we investigated the extent to which variation in epigenetic
modifications, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, are
associated with genetically controlled variation in gene expression.

\hypertarget{chromatin-state-overview}{%
\subsection{Chromatin state overview}\label{chromatin-state-overview}}

To investigate this association, we used ChromHMM to identify 14
chromatin states composed of unique combinations of four histone
modifications in the hepatocytes of nine inbred strains of mouse
(Methods). Figure XXX gives an overview of these states.

The states were distributed non-randomly around known functional
elements in the mouse genome (Figure XXX Genomic Enrichment). The
majority of the states were enriched around the TSS, and other
TSS-related functional elements, such as promoters and CpG islands. Two
states were primarily found in intergenic regions, three states were
enriched around known enhancers, and one was enriched predominantly near
the TES. The majority of these states were also associated with
variation in gene expression (Figure XXX Expression Effects). The
within-strain effects on expression (gray) were stronger in magnitude
than the across-strain effects (colored by states), but the direction of
the effects matched with only one exception.

The two states that were primarily located in intergenic regions were
associated with strong downregulation of genes when associated with
genes, suggesting that there is differential epigenetic silencing of
genes in hepatocytes across strains. That the majority of chromatin
states were associated with variation in expression across strains
suggests that epigenetic regulation of gene expression through histone
modification may contribute substantially to variation in gene
expression across genetically distinct individuals. That most states
have the same effects across genes within a cell type and across strains
suggests that the mechanisms that are used to regulate cell type
specificity also contribure to variation in genetically distinct
individuals.

By merging histone modification patterns with enrichments near
functional elements and effects on gene expression, we were able to
suggest annotations for many of the 14 chromatin states. A more detailed
description of these annotations is in Table XXX.

\hypertarget{spatial-distribution-of-epigenetic-modifications-around-gene-bodies}{%
\subsection{Spatial distribution of epigenetic modifications around gene
bodies}\label{spatial-distribution-of-epigenetic-modifications-around-gene-bodies}}

In addition to looking for enrichment of chromatin states near annotated
functional elements, we characterized the fine-grained spatial
distribution of each state around gene bodies (Figure XXXA-B). We also
characterized the distribution of CpG sites and their percent
methylation at this gene-level scale (Figure XXXC-D).

Each chromatin state had a unique pattern of spatial abundance (Figure
XXXA), and an overlay of all states together emphasizes the difference
in abundance between the most abundant states , and the remaining
states, which were relatively rare.

Each chromatin state had a characteristic distribution pattern relative
to gene bodies (Figure XXXA). For example, state 3, which was
characterized by the absence of all measured histone modifications, was
strongly depleted near the TSS, indicating that this region is commonly
subject to chromatin modification. However, its abundance increased
steadily to a peak at the TES. In contrast, states 11 and 10 were both
concentrated at the TSS. Whereas state 11 was very narrowly concentrated
right at the TSS, whereas state 10 was more broadly abundant both
upstream and downstream of the TSS. These differential distribution
patterns may speak to distinct functional roles in regulation of
expression.

The remaining states were relatively low in abundance compared to states
3, 10, and 11 (Figure XXXB), but also showed specific distributions
relative to the gene body. For example, state 12, which was overall
enriched around annotated TESs, was highly enriched just downstream of
the TES, depleted at the TSS, and enriched immediately up and downstream
of the TSS. In contrast, states 8 and 7 were most abundant inside the
gene body, and were relatively depleted at the TSS.

DNA methylation also showed strong positional effects (Figure XXXC and
D). Across all genes, the TSS had densely packed CpG sites relative to
the region between the TSS and TES (Figure XXXC). As expected, the
median CpG site near the TSS was consistently hypomethylated relative to
the median CpG site in intergenic regions. CpG sites within the gene
body were slightly hypermethylated compared to intergenic CpGs (Figure
XXXD).

\hypertarget{imputation-before-spatial-resolution}{%
\subsection{Imputation before spatial
resolution?}\label{imputation-before-spatial-resolution}}

To further investigate whether chromatin state contributes to
transcriptional variation across strains, we imputed local chromatin
state into a population of diversity outbred mice (REF).

\subsection{Imputed chromatin state was correlated with gene expression
in DO
mice}\label{imputed-chromatin-state-was-correlated-with-gene-expression-in-do-mice}}

To further investigate the relationship between genotype, epigenetic
features, and gene expression, we imputed chromatin state, DNA
methylation, and SNPs into a population of DO mice described previously
{[}Svenson, Tyler{]} (Methods). Gene expression was measured in whole
livers in these mice giving us the opportunity to explore the extent to
which local chromatin state corresponded with varation in gene
expression across individuals.

In addition to chromatin state, we also imputed DNA methylation state
and SNPs as comparators.

SNP imputation is almost certainly ground truth in the DO mice is
chromatin state is determined by (local?) genotype? how well does this
predict gene expression in animals with mixed up genomes of multiple
founders DNA methylation probably not determined by local genetics gives
lower bound on expectations for imputations if feature is not related to
gene expression

We compared the percent variance explained by local haplotype to the
maximum percent variance explained by local chromatin state, local
percent DNA methylation, and local SNPs for each transcript (Figure
XXXA).

Overall, local haplotype explained the largest amount of variance in
gene expression (\(R^2 = 0.31\)). The variance explained by local
chromatin state was very highly correlated with that of haplotype
(Pearson \(r = 0.95\)) and also explained a relatively high proportion
of variation in gene expression (\(R^2 = 0.28\)). Individual SNPs were
less correlated with haplotype (Pearson \(r = 0.69\)), and explained
less overall variance in gene expression (\(R^2 = 0.12\)). DNA
methylation, which previous results suggest is not genetically
determined, had the lowest correlation with haplotype (Pearson
\(r = 0.55\)) and explained the least variance in gene expression
(\(R^2 = 0.07\)).

An example of how different functional genomic features are associated
with gene expression is shown in Figure XXX.

finding supports idea that chromatin state is defined by local genetics
imputed chromatin almost as good as measured haplotype in explaining
variation in gene expression, but with higher resolution

that this worked in a population of genetically unique mice with
completely mixed up genomes speaks to just how much gene expression is
determined by local genetics.

Powerful observation that we can impute chromatin state in 500 DO mice
from measuring chromatin state in a handful of inbred mice

Gives us higher resolution than haplotype, without the loss of
explanatory power we get from SNP analysis

haplotype includes all genetically determined functional elements in a
relatively large region

SNPs do tag the haplotype, but are

Further, because chromatin modifications are measured at extremely high
density, we can map high-density chromatin effects in the DO mice, which
may help prioritize functional SNPs within gene bodies and in regulatory
regions.

For example, Figure XXX shows chromatin states across the gene Irf5 in
the inbred founders along with the LOD score and chromatin state effects
at each position along the gene body as calculated in the DO population.
The LOD scores and allele effects highlight variation at the TSS, and at
several internal positions in the gene as potentially regulating gene
expression.

\hypertarget{spatially-resolved-effects-on-gene-expression}{%
\subsection{Spatially resolved effects on gene
expression}\label{spatially-resolved-effects-on-gene-expression}}

The distinct spatial distributions of the chromatin states and
methylated CpG sites around the gene body raised the question as to
whether the effects of these states on gene expression could also be
spatially resolved. To investigate this possibility we tested the
association between both chromatin state and DNA methylation and gene
expression with a spatially resolved model (Methods). We tested the
effect of each chromatin state on expression across genes within a
strain (Figure XXX first column), the effect of each chromatin state on
the variation in gene expression across strains (Figure XXX second
column), and finally

\subsection{Variation in expression in an outbred population maps to
imputed chromatin
state}\label{variation-in-expression-in-an-outbred-population-maps-to-imputed-chromatin-state}}

A subset of the chromatin states was correlated with gene expression
across genes (Figure XXXC) in a manner that concorded with both their
histone modification profiles and their enrichments near functional
genomic elements. For example, the histone modification H3K27me3 has
been previously shown to be associated with lower transcript abundance
{[}CITE{]}. We found this modification in both states 2 and 3 (Figure
XXXA), which were both correlated with reduced transcription (Figure
XXXC). State 3, furthermore, was enriched near the TSS, promoters, TFBS,
and other regulatory elements supporting a possible role in
transcriptional regulation.

State 5 was characterized by the presence of two histone modifications
previously associated with increased transcription: H3K27ac {[}CITE{]},
and H3K4me1 {[}CITE{]}. The enrichment of this state in enhancers
coincides with previous work showing the presence of these two
modifications in active enhancers {[}21106759, 21160473, 29273804{]},
and supports the role of this state in upregulation of gene
transcription.

States 6 and 7 were also associated with increased transcription and the
presence of transcriptionally activating histone modifications. State 6
was modestly enriched in enhancers, while state 7 was enriched not only
in enhancers, but also stongly near the TSS and other associated
functional elements (Figure XXXB).

\hypertarget{dna-methylation-varied-across-the-gene-body}{%
\subsection{DNA methylation varied across the gene
body}\label{dna-methylation-varied-across-the-gene-body}}

In addition to chromatin state, we examined the distribution of DNA
methylation across the gene body, as well as the relationship between
DNA methylation and gene expression in both inbred mice and DO mice.

Within each strain, percent methylation at the gene TSS was slightly
negatively correlated with gene expression (Pearson r for all strains
was about -0.2). However, there was very little variation in DNA
methylation across strains, particularly at the TSS, and consequently,
there was no relationship between percent methylation and gene
expression across strains.

\hypertarget{chromatin-state-but-not-dna-methylation-correlated-with-gene-expression-across-strains}{%
\subsection{Chromatin state but not DNA methylation correlated with gene
expression across
strains}\label{chromatin-state-but-not-dna-methylation-correlated-with-gene-expression-across-strains}}

In stark contrast, DNA methylation was completely uncorrelated with
variation in gene expression across strains (Figure XXXB). This lack of
correlation is likely due to the low variability of percent methylation
across strains at any given position. Figure XXXC shows the standard
deviation in percent DNA methylation at normalized positions across the
gene body. It is strikingly low everywhere, with the standard deviation
being around 6\%, which is likely below any biologically functional
threshold. The variation dips even lower, to around 4\% at the TSS,
indicating that for the most part that DNA methylation does not vary
across strains and is not contributing to strain difference in gene
expression.

\hypertarget{annotation-of-chromatin-states}{%
\subsection{Annotation of chromatin
states}\label{annotation-of-chromatin-states}}

We identified 14 chromatin states corresponding to 14 distinct
combinations of histone modifications (Figure XXXA). To annotate these
states to functional elements, we combined previously known annotations
with functional enrichments and relationship to gene expression. The
characterizations are summarized in Figure XXX. Figure XXXA further
shows the relative abundance of each state in and around the gene body.
This high-resolution image of abundance helped further refine the
annotations of each state. Figure XXXB shows that overall states 1 and 7
were the most abundant states with state 7 being highly enriched at the
TSS, and state 1 being strongly depleted at the TSS, but enriched within
the gene body and in intragenic spaces. We describe the reasoning behind
the annotation of each state below:

\textbf{State 1 - heterochromatin} was characterized by the absence of
all measured marks, enrichment in intergenic regions, and strong
downregulation of gene expression. This state was strongly depleted at
the TSS of expressed genes (Figure XXXA), but the most abundant state in
the gene body and outside the gene body. This state may multiple
different states that could be resolved with the measurement of more
histone modifications. For example, intergenically, state 1 may mark
heterochromatin, which is characterized by H3K9 trimethylation
{[}12867029{]}, which was not measured here. However, state 1 was also
highly abundant in the gene bodies of expressed genes, but was
associated with reduced expression. This could suggest differential
distribution of heterochromatin across strains, or could represent an
additional transcriptionally repressive state.

\textbf{State 2 - repressed chromatin} was characterized by the presence
of H3K27me3, which has been shown previously to correlate with
transcriptional silencing {[}REF{]}. This state was not enriched in any
particular functional element, but was associated with strong
downregulation of transcription.

\textbf{State 3 - poised enhancer} was primarily characterized by the
presence of H3K27me3, a mark associated with polycomb silencing
{[}REF{]}, and H3K4me1 a mark associated with enhancers {[}REF{]}. The
co-occurence of these opposing marks has previously been associated with
a functional element known as a poised enhancer {[}21160473{]}.

This element has been studied mostly in the context of development.
Bivalent promoters are abundant in undifferentiated cells, and are
resolved either to active promoters or silenced promoters as the cells
differentiate into their final state {[}REF{]}. These promoters have
also been shown to be important in the response of cancer cells to
environmental disturbances such as hypoxia {[}REF{]}. The presence of
bivalent promoters in adult mouse hepatocytes is interesting. They may
mark genes poised for expression during liver regeneration, or for
responding to a particular environmental stimulus. There were XXX genes
that were marked with this bivalent promoter state at the TSS across all
strains. This group of genes was enriched for developmental processes as
well as alcohol metabolism (Fig? Table?).

\textbf{State 4 - intragenic enhancer} was characterized by the presence
of H3K4me1, which is known to mark cell type-specific enhancers, both
active and poised {[}REF{]}. The presence of H3K4me1 alone, in the
absence of H3K27ac, as it occurs in state 4, has been shown to mark
inactive, or poised enhancers {[}21106759{]}. The addition of H3K27ac
can then activate the enhancer to increase transcription. When present
within the gene body, this state acts as an intragenic enhancer, which
acts as an alternative promoter, and can be transcribed bidirectionally
to produce short RNAs known as eRNA {[}20393465{]}. This state was
modestly enriched in known enhancers and was associated with slightly
increased gene expression. The presence of H3K4me1 in the absence of
H3K4me3 has been shown to mark intragenic enhancers and to be associated
with increased transcription, as these regions can be transcribed
independently of the full gene {[}Kowalczyk et al.~2012{]}. We annotated
this state as a weak enhancer.

\textbf{State 5 - active enhancer} was characterized by the co-occurence
of H3K4me1, which marks cell type-specific enhancers, and H3K27ac, which
specifically marks active enhancers {[}21106759, 21160473{]}. This state
was strongly enriched in known enhancers, and its presence had a strong
postive effect on transcription. We thus annotated this state as a
strong enhancer.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

imputation gives us a way to do a very limited, gene-based GWAS? not
good wording, but we can potentially increase the resolution right
around gene bodies

The enrichment of these states in regulatory regions indicates the
possibility that these states are used for regulating expression levels
whereas states 7 and 3 at the transcription start site may be primarily
related to switching gene transcription on and off.

Haplotype and chromatin state represent broader regions of genome than
SNPs and DNA methylation, which are measured at the base pair level. The
measurements that represent larger regions of the genome are more
predictive of local gene expression than the point-wise measurements.

While local haplotype is the best predictor of gene expression, it has
poor resolution. SNPs and DNA methylation have very high resolution, but
are relatively poor predictors of gene expression. Chromatin state sits
in the middle ground. It is almost as good a predictor of gene
expression as haplotype, but has resolution down to 200 base pairs, thus
offering the potential for dissecting mechanisms of local gene
expression at a higher resolution than is possible with haplotype alone.

There is clearly a lot going on at the TSS, but there these results show
correlations between gene expression

Perhaps by overlaying all modalities, particularly with measurements of
open chromatin, we can come up with examples of this kind of inference?
Are there any anecdotes that illustrate this?

Local chromatin state was highly correlated with local gene expression
in the DO/CC founders. This was true across genes within each strain, as
well as for individual genes across strains, suggesting that variation
in chromatin modifications may be a major mechanism of local gene
expression regulation.

(Alternatively, chromatin state aligns well with the true local
mechanism of gene regulation, but is not itself a mechanism.)

RRBS discussion - In humans estimates of heritability of DNA methylation
are relatively low (0.1 to 0.3). It is estimated that around 10\% of
methylation sites are highly heritable. heritability estimates are age-
and population-specific.

Even if there are inherited patterns of DNA methylation, do they have
any effect on gene expression? Keep in mind that we are only looking at
local effects.

human studies have shown that trimodal sites (0, 0.5, 1) have relatively
high heritability (0.8), and almost half were associated with eQTLs.

no evidence for trans-generational inheritance of DNA methylation in
humans.

abundant around transcription start sites (TSS), while all other states
were depleted at the TSS. State 8 peaked in abundance immediately
downstream of the TSS, and state 9 peaked immediately upstream of the

State 5 had relatively low abundance. However, it was concentrated
within gene bodies where it had a relatively strong positive correlation
