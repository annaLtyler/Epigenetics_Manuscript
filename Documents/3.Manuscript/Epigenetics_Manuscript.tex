\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

It is well established that epigenetic features, such as histone
modifications and DNA methylation, are associated gene expression across
cell types. However, it is not well known how variation in genotype
affects epigenetic state, or to what extent such variation contributes
to variation in gene expression across genetically distinct individuals.
Here we investigated the relationship between heritable epigenetic
variation and gene expression in hepatocytes across nine inbred mouse
strains. Eight of the inbred strains were founders of the diversity
outbred (DO) mice, and the ninth was DBA/2J, which, along with C57BL/6J,
is one of the founders of the BxD recombinant inbred panel of mice. We
surveyed four histone modifications, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and
H3K27ac, as well as DNA methylation. We used ChromHMM to identify 14
chromatin states representing distinct combinations of the four measured
histone modifications. We found that variation in chromatin state
mirrored genetic variation across the inbred strains. Furthermore,
epigenetic variation was correlated with gene expression across strains.
The correspondence between epigenetic state and gene expression was
replicated in an independent population of DO mice in which we imputed
local epigenetic state. In contrast, we found that DNA methylation did
not vary across inbred strains and was not correlated with variation in
expression in DO mice. This work suggests that chromatin state is highly
influenced by local genotype and may be a primary mode through which
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are mediated. We further
demonstrate that strain variation in chromatin state, paired with gene
expression is useful for annotation of functional regions of the mouse
genome. Finally, we provide, to our knowledge, the first data resource
that documents variation in chromatin state across genetically distinct
individuals.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Epigenetic modifications to DNA and its associated histone proteins
influence the accessibility of DNA to transcription machinery, and are
associated with up- and down-regulation of gene expression {[}1--3{]}.
Across cell types, unique combinatorial patterns of histone
modifications mark chromatin states that establish cell type-specific
patterns of gene expression {[}4{]}. Similarly, the methylation of CpG
sites around gene promoters and enhancers influences transcription in a
cell type-specific manner {[}6,7{]}.

These patterns of histone modifications and DNA methylation are
established during development. The result is a canonical epigenetic
landscape for coordination of major patterns of gene expression for each
cell type {[}sources about development{]}. As an organism ages and
responds to its environment, patterns of both histone modifications
{[}citation{]} and of DNA methylation change {[}citation{]}. Such
changes have been linked to scenescence {[}Horvath clock{]} and cancer
{[}citations{]}.

Epigenetic modifications coordinate the usage of a single genome to be
used for many different types of cells with diverse morphology and
physiology. This amazing feature of epigenetic modifications has been
intensely studied, and the variation in epigenetic landscapes across
cell types has been extensively documented {[}citations{]}. Less well
understood, however, is the role that genetic variation plays in
determining epigenetic landscapes.

Across genetically diverse populations of humans or mice, individual
cell types, such as hepatocytes, or cardiomyocytes, have globally
similar gene expression profiles that define their role within the
greater organism. However, it is also true that across individuals, gene
expression varies widely within the global constraints of cell type.
This variation can increase or decrease an organism's risk of developing
disease. Variation in gene expression has been extensively mapped to
variation in genetic loci, or expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL).
Large, coordinated efforts, such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression
(GTEx) Project {[}32913073, 32913075{]} have identified and catalogued
many such loci in humans, and countless independent studies have
identified eQTL in mice and other model organisms.

Although the link between genetic variation and gene expression has been
well studied, there is relatively little known about inter-individual
variation in epigenetic modifications, and how these variations are
related to variations in genotype and gene expression. The generation of
a more complete picture of inter-individual variation in epigenetic
modifications has the potential to increase our understanding of the
mechanisms of gene regulation, provide insights into the mechanisms
establishing cell type-specific epigenetic landscapes, and to improve
the functional annotation of the genome as it relates to the regulation
of gene expression. The vast majority of SNPs associated with human
disease traits are located in non-coding regions, suggesting that they
influence gene regulation, rather than protein function {[}citation{]}.
However, annotation of these regions is difficult without additional
genomic features, such as histone modifictions and DNA methylation.
Overlaying a map of variation in epigenetic features has the potential
to provide a picture of how genetic variation changes functional
elements, like enhancers and insulators, in the genome {[}citation{]}.

Advances in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequencing
technologies now enable genome-wide surveys of histone modifications
with relatively few cells {[}8{]}, thus opening the door to the
possibility of cataloging epigenetic variation across cell types and
individuals. Here, we performed a survey of epigenetic variation in
hepatocytes across nine inbred mouse strains. We included the eight
founders of the Diversity Outbred/Collaborative Cross (DO/CC) {[}9{]}
mice, as well as DBA/2J, which, along with C57BL/6J, is one of the
founders of the widely used BxD recombinant inbred panel of mice
{[}10{]}. We assayed four histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3,
H3K27me3, and H3K27ac), as well as DNA methylation. We used ChromHMM
{[}11{]} to identify 14 chromatin states, classified by unique
combinations of the four histone marks, and investigated the association
between variation in these states and variation in gene expression
across the nine strains. We separately investigated the relationship
between DNA methylation and gene expression across strains.

We further investigated the relationship between epigenetic state and
gene expression by imputing the 14 chromatin states and DNA methylation
into a population of DO mice. We then mapped gene expression to the
imputed epigenetic states to assess the extent to which eQTLs are driven
by variation in epigenetic modification. We thus linked genetically
controlled variation in epigentic modifications to variation in gene
expression in mice, and we provide the first resource documenting
epigenetic variation across a wide panel of genetically diverse mice.

\hypertarget{inbred-mice}{%
\subsection{Inbred Mice}\label{inbred-mice}}

Three female mice from each of nine inbred strains were used. Eight of
these strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ, NOD/ShiLtJ,
NZO/HlLtJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) are the eight strains that served as
founders of the Collaborative Cross/Diversity Outbred mice {[}12{]}. The
ninth strain, DBA/2J, will facilitate the interpretation of existing and
forthcoming genetic mapping data obtained from the BxD recombinant
inbred strain panel. Samples were harvested from the mice at 12 weeks of
age.

\hypertarget{liver-perfusion}{%
\subsubsection{Liver perfusion}\label{liver-perfusion}}

To purify hepatocytes from the liver cell population, the mouse livers
were perfused with 87 CDU/mL Liberase collagenase with 0.02\% CaCl2 in
Leffert's buffer to digest the liver into a single-cell suspension, and
then isolated using centrifugation.

We aliquoted \(5 x 10^{6}\) cells for each RNA-Seq and bisulfite
sequencing, and the rest were cross-linked for ChIP assays. Both
aliquots were spun down at 200 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in
\(1200\mu L\) RTL+BME (for RNA-Seq) or frozen as a cell pellet in liquid
nitrogen (for bisulfite sequencing). In the sample for ChIP-Seq, protein
complexes were cross-linked to DNA using 37\% formaldehyde in methanol.
All cell samples were stored at -80°C until used (See Supplemental
Methods for more detail).

\hypertarget{hepatocyte-histone-binding-and-gene-expression-assays}{%
\subsubsection{Hepatocyte histone binding and gene expression

Hepatocyte samples from 30 treatment and control mice were used in the
following assays:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  RNA-seq to quantify mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression, with
  approximately 30 million reads per sample.
\item
  Reduced-representation bisulfate sequencing to identify methylation
  states of approximately two million CpG sites in the genome. The
  average read depth was 20-30x.
\item
  Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing to assess binding of the
  following histone marks:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}

\item
  H3K27ac, to identify actively used enhancers
\item
  A negative control (input chromatin)
\end{enumerate}

Samples are sequenced with \(\sim40\) million reads per sample.

The samples for RNA-Seq in RTL+BME buffer were sent to The Jackson
Laboratory Gene Expression Service for RNA extraction and library
synthesis.

\hypertarget{histone-chromatin-immunoprecipitation-assays}{%
\subsubsection{Histone chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays}\label{histone-chromatin-immunoprecipitation-assays}}

After exdtraction, hepatocyte cells were lysed to release the nuclei,
spun down, and resuspended in 130ul MNase buffer with 1mM PMSF and 1x
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) to prevent histone protein
degradation. The samples were then digested with 15U of micrococcal
nuclease (MNase), which digests the exposed DNA, but leaves the
nucleosome-bound DNA intact. We confirmed digestion of nucleosomes into
150bp fragments with with agarose gel. The digestion reaction was
stopped with EDTA and samples were used immediately in ChIP assay. The
ChIP assay was performed with Dynabead Protein G beads and histone
antibodies. After binding to antibodies, samples were washed to remove
unboud chromatin and then eluted with high-salt buffer and proteinase K
to digest protein away from DNA-protein complexes. The DNA was purified
using the Qiagen PCR purification kit. Quantification was performed
using the Qubit quantification system (See Supplemental Methods).

\hypertarget{diversity-outbred-mice}{%
\subsection{Diversity Outbred mice}\label{diversity-outbred-mice}}

We used previously published data from a population of 478 diversity
outbred (DO) mice {[}9{]} to compare to the data collected from the
inbred mice. The DO population included males and females from DO
generations four through 11. Mice were randomly assigned to either a
chow diet (6\% fat by weight, LabDiet 5K52, LabDiet, Scott Distributing,
Hudson, NH), or a high-fat, high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet (45\% fat, 40\%
carbohydrates, and 15\% protein) (Envigo Teklad TD.08811, Envigo,
Madison, WI). Mice were maintained on this diet for 26 weeks.

\hypertarget{genotyping}{%
\subsubsection{Genotyping}\label{genotyping}}

All DO mice were genotyped as described in {[}9{]} using the Mouse
Universal Genotyping Array (MUGA) (7854 markers), and the MegaMUGA
(77,642 markers) (GeneSeek, Lincoln, NE). All animal procedures were
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at The Jackson Laboratory
(Animal Use Summary \# 06006).

Founder haplotypes were inferred from SNPs using a Hidden Markov Model
as described in {[}13{]}. The MUGA and MegaMUGA arrays were merged to
create a final set of evenly spaced 64,000 interpolated markers.

\hypertarget{tissue-collection-and-gene-expression}{%
\subsubsection{Tissue collection and gene

At sacrifice, whole livers were collected and gene expression was
measured using RNA-Seq as described in (Chick, Munger et
al.\textasciitilde2016, and Tyler et al.\textasciitilde2017). Transcript
sequences were aligned to strain-specific genomes, and we used an
expectation maximization algorithm (EMASE) to estimate read counts
(\url{https://github.com/churchill-lab/emase}).

\hypertarget{data-processing}{%
\subsection{Data Processing}\label{data-processing}}

\hypertarget{sequence-processing}{%
\subsubsection{Sequence processing}\label{sequence-processing}}

The raw sequencing data from both RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq was put through
the quality control program FastQC (version), and duplicate sequences
were removed before downstream analysis. Reads from each sample were
mapped to strain-specific pseudogenomes, which integrate known SNPs and
indels from each strain, and the B6 samples were aligned directly to the
reference mouse genome. The pseudogenomes were created using EMASE
\textbackslash url(https://github.com/churchill-lab/emase). We used
Bowtie {[}14{]} to align and map reads from the RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq
experiments.

\hypertarget{transcript-quantification}{%
\subsubsection{Transcript
quantification}\label{transcript-quantification}}

We quantified gene expression using edgeR {[}15{]}, and transcripts with
less than 1 CPM in two or more replicates were filtered out. Transcripts
were further filtered to include only protein-coding transcripts.

We used the R package sva {[}16{]} to perform a variance stabilizing
transformation (vst) on the RNA-Seq read counts from both inbred and
outbred mice. In the inbred mice we used a blind transformation, while
in the outbred mice, we included DO wave and sex in the model. For eQTL
mapping, we performed rank Z normalization on the RNA-Seq read counts
across transcripts from the outbred mice.

\hypertarget{chip-seq-quantification}{%
\subsubsection{ChIP-Seq quantification}\label{chip-seq-quantification}}

We used MACS 1.4.2 {[}17{]} to identify peaks in the ChIP-Seq sequencing
data, with a significance threshold of \(p \leq 10^{-5}\). In order to
compare peaks across strains, we converted the MACS output peak
coordinates to common B6 coordinates using g2g tools
(https://churchill-lab.github.io/g2gtools/).

\hypertarget{quantifying-dna-methylation}{%
\subsection{Quantifying DNA
methylation}\label{quantifying-dna-methylation}}

RRBS data were processed using a bismark-based pipeline modified from
{[}18{]}. The pipeline uses Trim Galore! 0.6.3
(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim\_galore/) for
QC, followed by the trimRRBSdiversityAdaptCustomers.py script from NuGen
for trimming the diversity adapters. This script is available at:
https://github.com/nugentechnologies/NuMetRRBS

All samples had comparable quality levels and no outstanding flags.
Total number of reads was 45-90 million, with an average read length of
about 50 bp. Quality scores were mostly above 30 (including error bars),
with the average above 38. Duplication level was reduced to \(<2\) for
about 95\% of the sequences.

High quality reads were aligned to a custom strain pseudogenomes, using
bowtie2 as implemented in Bismark 0.22 {[}19{]}. The pseudogenomes were
created by incorporating strain-specific SNPs and indels into the
reference genome using g2gtools
(https://github.com/churchill-lab/g2gtools), allowing a more precise
characterization of methylation patterns. Bismark methylation extractor
tool was then used for creating a bed file of estimated methylation
proportions for each animal, which was then translated to the reference
mouse genome (GRCm38) coordinates using g2gtools. Unlike other liftover
tools, g2gtools does not throw away alignments that land on indel
regions. B6 samples were aligned directly to the reference mouse genome.

\hypertarget{analysis-of-histone-modifications}{%
\subsection{Analysis of histone
modifications}\label{analysis-of-histone-modifications}}

\hypertarget{identification-of-chromatin-states}{%
\subsubsection{Identification of chromatin
states}\label{identification-of-chromatin-states}}

We used ChromHMM {[}20{]} to identify chromatin states, which are unique
combinations of the four chromatin modifications, for example, high
levels of both H3K4me3 and H3K4me1, and low levels of the other two
modifications. We conducted all subsequent analyses at the level of the
chromatin state.

To ensure we were analyzing the most biologically meaningful chromatin
states, we calculated chromatin states for all numbers of states between
four and 16, which is the maximum number of states possible with four
binary chromatin modifications (\(2^n\)). We aligned states across the
models by assigning each to one of the sixteen possible binary states
using an emissions probability of 0.3 as the threshold for
presence/absence of the histone mark. We then investigated the stability
of three features across all states: the emissions probabilities (Supp
Fig1), the abundance of each state across transcribed genes (Supp Fig2),
and the effect of each state on transcription (Supp Fig3). Methods for
each of these analyses are described separately below. All measures were
remarkably consistent across all models, but the 14-state model was
characterized by a wide range of relatively abundant states with
relatively strong effects on expression. We used this model for all
subsequent analyses. For more details on how the different models were
compared, see Supplemental Methods.

\hypertarget{genome-distribution-of-chromatin-states}{%
\subsubsection{Genome distribution of chromatin
states}\label{genome-distribution-of-chromatin-states}}

We investigated genomic distributions of chromatin states in two ways.
First, we used the ChromHMM function OverlapEnrichment to calculate
enrichment of each state around known functional elements in the mouse
genome. We analyzed the following features:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Transcription start sites (TSS)} - Annotations of TSS in the
  mouse genome were provided by RefSeq {[}21{]} and included with the
  release of ChromHMM, which we downloaded on December 9, 2019
  {[}29120462{]}.
\item
  \textbf{Transcription end sites (TES)} - Annotations of TES in the
  mouse genome were provided by RefSeq and included with the release of
  ChromHMM.
\item
  \textbf{Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)} - We downloaded
  TFBS coordinates from OregAnno {[}22{]} using the UCSC genome browser
  {[}23{]} on May 4, 2021.
\item
  \textbf{Promoters} - We downloaded promoter coordinates provided by
  the eukaryotic promoter database {[}24,24{]}, through the UCSC genome
  browser on April 26, 2021.
\item
  \textbf{Enhancers} - We downloaded annotated enhancers provided by
  ChromHMM through the UCSC genome browser on April 26, 2021.
\item
  \textbf{Candidates of cis regulatory elements in the mouse genome
  (cCREs)} - We downloaded cCRE annotations provided by ENCODE {[}25{]}
  through the UCSC genome browser on April 26, 2021.
\item
  \textbf{CpG Islands} - Annotations of CpG islands in the mouse genome
  were included with the release of ChromHMM.
\end{itemize}

In addition to these enrichments around individual elements, we also
calculated chromatin state abundance relative to the main anatomical
features of a gene. For each transcribed gene, we normalized the base
pair positions to the length of the gene such that the transcription
start site (TSS) was fixed at 0, and the transcription end site (TES)
was fixed at 1. We also included 1000 bp upstream of the TSS and 1000 bp
downstream of the TES, which were converted to values below 0 and above
1 respectively.

To map chromatin states to the normalized positions, we binned the
normalized positions into 41 bins defined by the sequence from -2 to 2
incremented by 0.1. If a bin encompassed multiple positions in the gene,
we assigned the mean value of the feature of interest to the bin. To
avoid potential contamination from regulatory regions of nearby genes,
we only included genes that were at least 2kb from their nearest
neighbor, for a final set of 14048 genes.

\hypertarget{chromatin-state-and-gene-expression}{%
\subsubsection{Chromatin state and gene
expression}\label{chromatin-state-and-gene-expression}}

We calculated the effect of each chromatin state on gene expression. We
did this both across genes and across strains. The across-gene analysis
identified states that are associated with high expression and low
expression within the hepatocytes and independent of strain. The
across-strain analysis investigated whether variation in chromatin state
across strains contributed to variation in gene expression across
strains.

For each transcribed gene, we calculated the proportion of the gene body
that was assigned to each chromatin state. We then fit a linear model
separately for each state to calculate the effect of state proportion
with gene expression:

\begin{equation*}{\label{eqn:chromatin_effect}}
y_{e} = \beta x_{s} + \epsilon
\end{equation*}

where \(y_{e}\) is the rank Z normalized gene expression of the full
transcriptome in a single inbred strain, and \(x_{s}\) is the rank Z
normalized proportion of each gene that was assigned to state \(s\). We
fit this model for each strain and each state to yield one \(\beta\)
coefficient with 95\% confidence interval. The effects were not
different across strains, so we averaged the effects and confidence
intervals across strains to yield one summary effect for each state.

To calculate the effect of each chromatin state across strains, we first
standardized transcript abundance across strains for each transcript. We
also standardized the proportion of each chromatin state for each gene
across strains. We then fit the same linear model, where \(y_{e}\) was a
rank Z normalized vector concatenating all standardized expression
levels across all strains, and \(x_{s}\) was a rank Z normalized vector
concatenating all standardized state proportions across all strains. We
fit the model for each state independently yielding a \(\beta\)
coefficient and 95\% confidence interval for each state.

In addition to calculating the effect of state proportion across the
full gene body, we also performed the same calculations in a
position-based manner. This second analysis yielded an effect of each
state at multiple points along the gene body and a more nuanced view of
the effect of each state.

\subsubsection{Creation of DNA
methylome}\label{creation-of-dna-methylome}}

We combined the DNA methylation data into a single methylome cataloging
the methylated sites across all strains. For each site, we averaged the
percent methylation across the three replicates in each strain. The
final methylome contained 5,311,670 unique sites across the genome.
Because methylated CpG sites can be fully methylated, unmethylated, or
hemi-methylated, we rounded the average percent methylation at each site
to the nearest 0, 50, or 100\%.

We used the enrichment function in ChromHMM described above to identify
enrichment of CpG sites around functional elements in the mouse genome.
We further performed a gene-based analysis of abundance similar to that
in the chromatin states. As a function of relative position on the gene
body, we calculated the density of CpG sites as the average distance to
the next downstream CpG site, as well as the percent methylation at each
site.

\hypertarget{effects-of-dna-methylation-on-gene-expression}{%

As with chromatin state, we assessed the effect of DNA methylation on
gene expression both across genes and across strains. We used the same
linear model described above, except that \(y_{s}\) became the rank Z
normalized percent methylation either across genes or across strains.
Because the effect of DNA methylation on gene expression is well-known
to be dependent on position, we only calculated a position-dependent
effect on expression.

\hypertarget{imputation-of-genomic-features-in-diversity-outbred-mice}{%
\subsection{Imputation of genomic features in Diversity Outbred
mice}\label{imputation-of-genomic-features-in-diversity-outbred-mice}}

To assess the extent to which chromatin state and DNA methylation were
responsible for local expression QTLs, we imputed local chromatin state
and DNA methylation into a population of diversity outbred (DO) mice
described above and in {[}9{]}. We compared the effect of the imputed
epigenetic features to imputed SNPs.

All imputations followed the same basic procedure: For each transcript,
we identified the haplotype probabilities in the DO mice at the genetic
marker nearest the gene transcription start site. This matrix held DO
individuals in rows and DO founder haplotypes in columns (Supp. Fig.
\ref{supp_fig:imputation}).

For each transcript, we also generated a three-dimensional array
representing the genomic features derived from the DO founders. This
array held DO founders in rows, feature state in columns, and genomic
position in the third dimension. The feature state for chromatin
consisted of states one through 14, for SNPs feature state consisted of
the genotypes A,C,G, and T.

We then multiplied the haplotype probabilities by each genomic feature
array to obtain the imputed genomic feature for each DO mouse. This
final array held DO individuals in rows, the genomic feature in the
second dimension, and genomic position in the third dimension. This
array is analagous to the genoprobs object in R/qtl2 {[}26{]}. The
genomic position dimension included all positions from 1 kb upstream of
the TSS to 1 kb downstream of the TES. SNP data for the DO founders in
mm10 coordinates were downloaded from the Sanger SNP database
{[}27,28{]}, on July 6, 2021.

To calculate the effect of each imputed genomic feature on gene
expression in the DO population, we fit a linear model. From this linear
model, we calculated the variance explained (\(R^2\)) by each genomic
feature, thereby relating gene expression in the DO to each position of
the imputed feature in and around the gene body.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

Gene expression varies widely and reproducibly across inbred strains of
mice. This is seen as a clustering of individuals from the same strain
in a principal component plot of the hepatocyte transcriptome across
strains (Figure \ref{fig:pc_plots}A). Patterns of DNA methylation
(Figure \ref{fig:pc_plots}B) and individual histone modifications
(Figure \ref{fig:pc_plots}C-F) cluster in a similar pattern. This
suggests that these epigenetic features may relate to gene expression in
a manner that is consistent with genetic background.

\hypertarget{chromatin-state-overview}{%
\subsection{Chromatin state overview}\label{chromatin-state-overview}}

To investigate this association, we used ChromHMM to identify 14
chromatin states composed of unique combinations of four histone
modifications in the hepatocytes of nine inbred strains of mice. Panel A
in Figure \ref{fig:state_overview} shows the representation of each
histone modification across the states.

The states were distributed non-randomly around known functional
elements in the mouse genome (Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}B). The
majority of the states were enriched around the TSS, and other
TSS-related functional elements, such as promoters and CpG islands. Two
states (states 13 and 14) were primarily found in intergenic regions.
Three states (states 6, 2, and 4) were enriched around known enhancers,
and one (state 9) was enriched predominantly near the TES. The majority
of these states were also associated with variation in gene expression.
The colored bars in Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}C) show the effect of
each state on gene expression across the inbred strains. For reference,
the paired tan bars show the effect of each chromatin state on gene
expression in hepatocytes. These effects tend to be of the same sign and
greater magnitude than the across-strain effects.

The states in Figure \ref{fig:state_overview} are shown in order of
their effect on expression, which helps illustrate several patterns in
the data. The state with the largest negative effect on gene expression,
state 14, is the absence of all measured modifications. The next few
states all contain the repressive mark H3K27me3, and are all associated
with reduced gene expression. The states with the largest positive
effects on expression all have some combination of the activating marks,
H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac. The repressive mark is less commonly seen
in these activating states.

By merging the information from Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}A-C), we
were able to suggest annotations for many of the 14 chromatin states
(Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}D). States with the strongest effects on
expression had the clearest annotations, while states with weaker
effects remained unannotated.

\hypertarget{spatial-distribution-of-epigenetic-modifications-around-gene-bodies}{%
\subsection{Spatial distribution of epigenetic modifications around gene
bodies}\label{spatial-distribution-of-epigenetic-modifications-around-gene-bodies}}

In addition to looking for enrichment of chromatin states near annotated
functional elements, we characterized the fine-grained spatial
distribution of each state around gene bodies (Figure
\ref{fig:state_abundance}A-B). We similarly characterized the
distribution of CpG sites and their percent methylation at this
gene-level scale (Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}C-D).

The spatial patterns of the individual chromatin states are shown in
(Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}A), and an overlay of all states
together (Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}B) emphasizes the difference
in abundance between the most abundant states (states 1, 3, and 14), and
the remaining states, which were relatively rare.

Each chromatin state had a characteristic distribution pattern relative
to gene bodies. For example, state 14, which was characterized by the
absence of all measured histone modifications, was strongly depleted
near the TSS, indicating that this region is commonly subject to histone
modification. However, its abundance increased steadily through the gene
to a peak at the TES. In contrast, states 3 and 1 were both concentrated
at the TSS. State 3 was very narrowly concentrated right at the TSS,
whereas state 1 was more broadly abundant both upstream and downstream
of the TSS. Both were associated overall with increased expression in
the inbred mice (indicated by red shading), suggesting promoter or
enhancer functions. The third state in this group of high-expressing
states, state 2, was depleted nere the TSS, but enriched within the gene
body, suggesting that this state may mark active intragenic enhancers.

States with weaker effects on expression (indicated by grayer shades)
were of lower abundance. However, they still had distinct distribution
patterns around the gene body suggesting the possibility of distinct
functional roles in the regulation of gene expression.

There were similarly dramatic spatial patterns in DNA methylation
(Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}C-D). Across all genes, the TSS had
densely packed CpG sites relative to the gene body (Figure
\ref{fig:state_abundance}C). As expected, the median CpG site near the
TSS was consistently hypomethylated relative to the median CpG site in
intergenic regions (Figure \ref{fig:state_abundance}D). CpG sites within
the gene body were slightly hypermethylated compared to intergenic CpGs.

\hypertarget{spatially-resolved-effects-on-gene-expression}{%
\subsection{Spatially resolved effects on gene
expression}\label{spatially-resolved-effects-on-gene-expression}}

The distinct spatial distributions of the chromatin states and
methylated CpG sites around the gene body raised the question as to
whether the effects of these states on gene expression could also be
spatially resolved. To investigate this possibility we tested the
association between both chromatin state and DNA methylation and gene
expression with spatially resolved models (Methods). We tested the
effect of each chromatin state on expression across genes within
hepatocytes (Figure \ref{fig:state_effects}A) and the effect of each
chromatin state on the variation in gene expression across strains
(Figure \ref{fig:state_effects}B).

All chromatin states demonstrated spatially dependent effects on gene
expression within hepatocytes. For many of the states, the effects on
expression were concentrated at or near the TSS, while in the other
states effects were seen across the whole gene. The direction of the
effects matched the overall effects of each state seen previously
(Figure \ref{fig:state_overview}). Remarkably, the spatial effects were
recapitulated for almost every state when we measured across strains.
That is, variation in chromatin state across strains contributed to
variation in gene expression in the same manner that cell-type
expression was being established. One notable exception was state 6,
whose presence upregulated genes within hepatocytes, but did not
contribute to expression variation across strains.

We also examined the effect of percent DNA methylation across genes
within hepatocytes, and across strains (Figure
\ref{fig:DNA_methylation_effect}). As expected, methylation at the TSS
was associated with lower expression in hepatocytes. However, percent
DNA methylation did not contribute at all to expression variation across
strains, implying that although percent DNA methylation is used in gene
regulation within a cell type, it is not heritable and does not
contribute to variation in gene expression across genetically diverse
individuals.

\hypertarget{imputed-chromatin-state-explained-expression-variation-in-diversity-outbred-mice}{%
\subsection{Imputed chromatin state explained expression variation in
diversity outbred
mice}\label{imputed-chromatin-state-explained-expression-variation-in-diversity-outbred-mice}}

Thus far, we have used inbred strains of mice to identify correlations
between local chromatin state and gene expression. However, we cannot
establish causality in this population. For that we need a mapping
population in which we can associate genetic or epigenetic variation at
a single locus with changes in gene expression. A mapping population
also allows us to establish the extent to which variation in epigenetic
factors contributes to observed expression quantitative trait loci
(eQTL).

To compare the contribution of genetic and epigenetic features to eQTLs
in a gentically diverse population, we imputed chromatin state, DNA
methylation, and SNPs into a population of DO mice (Methods). Chromatin
state is largely determined by local genotype, especially early in life
{[}REF{]}, and can thus be reliably imputed from local genotype.
Further, we have shown here that local chromatin state correlates with
variation in gene expression across inbred strains. DNA methylation, on
the other hand, is known not to be highly heritable {[}REF{]}, and thus
cannot be reliably imputed from local genotype. We have also shown here
that DNA methylation is not correlated with variation in gene expression
across inbred strains. The imputation of DNA methylation thus serves as
an estimate of a lower bound the ability of a feature imputed from local
haplotype to explain gene expression in a new population.

For each transcript in the DO population, we imputed the local chromatin
state across the gene body based on the gene's local founder haplotype
and the chromatin state at the corresponding position in the inbred
mice. We did the same for DNA methylation and SNPs.

After imputing each genomic feature into the DO population, we mapped
gene expression to the imputed features and calculated the variance
explained. Examples of each genomic feature and the mapping results for
the gene \textit{Pkd2} are shown in Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}. There
are two particularly interesting regions in this gene. One is at the TSS
and the immediately surrounding area, and the other is just downstream
of the TSS.

These two regions are colored red, indicating that they are marked by
chromatin states with a positive effect on gene expression. The order of
the rows in this panel helps illustrate that the strains with the most
red in chromatin state space contributed the highest-expressing alleles
to the DO (Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}E). The two haplotypes with the
strongest negative effect on gene expression in the DO have mostly blue
chromatin states in these two regions. These two strains also had the
lowest expression among the inbred mice (Figure
\ref{fig:example_gene}F). The concordance between chromatin state and
gene expression in the DO is seen as the blue pluses in Figure
\ref{fig:example_gene}A that are aligned with the two red regions, which
we suggest are putative enhancer regions.

The spatial patterns in the SNPs only partially mirror those in
chromatin state (Figure Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}C). SNPs underlying
the putative enhancer regions could potentially influence gene
expression by altering chromatin state. But SNPs downstream of this
region underly invariant chromatin.

Percent DNA methylation does not vary across the strains in either of
these putative enhancer regions, and does not contribute to variation in
expression across genetically distinct individuals (Figure
\ref{fig:example_gene}D).

The overall distributions of variance explained by each feature across
all transcripts is shown in Figure \ref{fig:effect_distrubutions}. These
distributions show the haplotype effect for the marker nearest each
transcript compared with the maximum effect across the gene body for
each of the other imputed features. Overall, local haplotype explained
the largest amount of variance of gene expression in the DO
(\(R^2 = 0.17\)). The variance explained by local chromatin state was
very highly correlated with that of haplotype (Pearson \(r = 0.96\)) and
explained almost as much variance in gene expression in the DO as local
haplotype (\(R^2 = 0.15\)).

The mean variance explained by SNPs was lower (\(R^2 = 0.13\)) than that
explained by haplotype and was not as highly correlated with local
haplotype as chromatin state was (Pearson \(r = 0.93\)). DNA
methylation, the lower bound for variance explained by a feature imputed
from local haplotype, explained the lowest amount of expression variance
in the DO population (\(R^2 = 0.09\)), and had a much lower correlation
to haplotype than either chromatin state or SNPs (Pearson \(r = 0.74\)).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

In this sudy we showed that variation in histone modifications in inbred
mice mirrors genetic variation, and we further showed that this
variation was highly related to variation in gene expression across
strains. These observations suggest that cell type-specific patterns of
histone modifications are determined by local genotype, and may be a
major mechanism through which expression QTL (eQTL) are generated. This
hypothesis was supported by the high concordance between chromatin
state, which was imputed from local genotype, and gene expression in an
independent outbred population of mice.

The high resolution of the chromatin states combined with spatial
patterns of abundance and effect on gene expression offers opportunities
for the annotation of functional elements in and around genes. For
example, the chromatin state patterns in the gene \textit{Pkd2}, suggest
two enhancers -- one at the TSS, and the other just downstream of the
TSS inside the gene body. The positive effects of these putative
enhancer regions in the inbred mice were replicated in outbred mice
suggesting that these effects are robust and contribute to variation in
gene expression seen in diverse populations.

The putative enhancers are not apparent in the SNP patterns or in the
patterns or DNA methylation, which suggests that chromatin modification
is the primary mechanism through which gene expression is regulated by
these regions. Further, the richness of the information in this
chromatin state layer provides data with which to further annotate the
effects of SNPs underlying these regions. There are SNPs throughout the
gene, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}, and many of them are
associated with variation in gene expression. However, while the SNPs
within the putative enhancer regions may change expression by altering
histone modifications placed in those regions, SNPs futher downstream
may work through another mechanism, such as through directly dirsupting
transcription, or by altering the transcript such that it is processed
differently post transcriptionally. The intermediate resolution of the
chromatin state between that of SNPs and haplotype thus provides a
highly informative layer of information between genotype and gene
expression.

In contrast to chromatin state, percent DNA methylation was not
associated with variation in gene expression across inbred strains or in
the outbred population. This was largely due to a lack of variation in
methylation across strains. An example of this observation is shown in
panel D of Figure \ref{fig:example_gene}. Despite strain variation in
both genotype and chromatin state at the TSS of \textit{Pkd2}, DNA
methylation is invariant -- the CpG island at the TSS is unmethylated in
all strains. Thus, although chromatin state appears to be highly
influenced by local genotype, percent DNA methylation is not.

Similar observations have been made in human studies {[}33931130{]}.
Multiple twin studies have estimated the average heritability of
individual CpG sites to be roughly 0.19 {[}27051996, 24183450,
22532803{]}, with only about 10\% of CpG sites having a heritability
greater than 0.5 {[}24183450, 22532803, 24887635{]}. Trimodal CpG sites,
i.e.~those with methylation percent varying among 0, 50, and 100\%, have
been shown in human brain tissue to be more heritable than unimodal, or
bimodal sites (\(h^2 = 0.8 \pm 0.18\)), and roughly half were associated
with local eQTL {[}20485568{]}. Here, we did not see an association
between trimodal CpG sites and gene expression across strains
(Supplemental Figure XXX).

The diversity in the effects observed in the 14 chromatin states
highlights the importance of analyzing combinatorial states as opposed
to individual histone modifications. To illustrate this point, consider
the three states with the largest positive effects on transcription.
Each of these three states had a distinct combination of the three
histone marks associated with transcriptional activation: H3K4me1,
H3K4me3, and H3K27ac. State 3 was characterized by high levels of
H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and low levels of H3K4me1. State 2 was
characterized by high levels of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, and low levels of
H3K4me3. And state 1 was characterized by high levels of all three
activating marks (Figure XXX). Although all three states were associated
with increased gene expression, each had a completely distinct spatial
distribution. State 3 was distributed in a very narrow band centered on
the TSS, while state 1 was distributed across a much broader region
centered upstream of the TSS. State 2 had a completely different
distribution -- it was depleted at the TSS, and most abundant within the
gene body and near the TES. This variation in spatial distribution was
mirrored in the spatial effects on transcription. State 3, which we
annotated as an active promoter, was positively associated with
transcription when it was present at the TSS. In contrast, states 2 and
1, which we annotated as enhancers, were associated with increased
transcription when present anywhere in the gene body (Figure XXX). We
would not be able to detect such patterns if analyzing the histone
modifications in isolation. These results highlight the complexity of
the histone code and the importance at analyzing combinatorial states.

While we were able to annotate several states, particularly those with
the strongest effects on gene expression, other states were more
difficult to annotate. This raises the intruiguing possibility of
identifying new modes of expression regulation through histone
modification. One of these unannotated states, state 9, had a weak, but
consistent negative effect on gene transcription centered within the
gene body, downstream of the TSS. This state was characterized by high
levels of H3K4me3 and low levels of the other three modifications.

The modification H3K4me3 is most frequently associated with increased
transcriptional activity {[}citation{]}, so the association with state 9
with reduced transcription is a deviation from the dominant paradigm.
The physical distribution of this state is also interesting. It was
depleted at the TSS, and enriched just upstream and just downstream of
the TSS (Figuree XXX). It was also enriched just downstream of the TES,
although it did not appear to influence transcription at this location
(Figure XXX). The group of genes marked by state 9 were enriched for
functions such as stress response, DNA damage repair, and ncRNA
processing suggesting that this state may be used to regulate subsets of
genes involved in responses to environmental stimuli.

There were other states that we were able to annotate, but were not
necessarily expecting to see in this study. We detected two bivalent
states, which are states that combine an activating histone modification
and a repressing histone modificaction and are usually associated with
undifferentiated cells {[}citation{]}. Here we identified two bivalent
states in adult mouse hepatocytes, and annotated them as a poised
enhancer (state 12) and a bivalent promoter (state 11). Both states were
associated with downregulation across inbred strains when present near
the TSS; however this effect was not replicated in the outbred mice. The
lack of replication was perhaps because the effect was too weak to
detect given the number of animals in the population.

Both bivalent promoters and poised enhancers are dynamic states that
change over the course of differentiation and in response to external
stimuli {[}citation{]}. Bivalent promoters have been studied primarily
in the context of development. They are abundant in undifferentiated
cells, and are typically resolved either to active promoters or to
silenced promoters as the cells differentiate into their final state
{[}23788621, 22513113{]}. These promoters have also been shown to be
important in the response to changes in the environment. Their abundance
increases in breast cancer cells in response to hypoxia {[}27800026{]}.
Poised enhancers are also observed during differentiation and in
differentiated cells {[}32432110{]}. In concordance with these previous
observations, the genes marked by states 12 and 11 were enriched for
vascular development and morphogenesis. That we identified these states
in differentiated hepatocytes may indicate that a subset of
developmental genes retain the ability to be activated under certain
circumstances, such as during liver regeneration in response to damage.
It is also possible these states were induced in the inbred strains in
respose to stress, rather than genetically coded. This could explain why
the negative effect on gene expression was not replicated in the outbred
mice. However, given that we detected this state in all nine inbred
strains in relatively equal proportions, this latter hypothesis seems
less likely.

Broadly, local variation in chromatin state was highly correlated with
variation in gene expression across individuals, an observation that was
replicated in an independent population of genetically diverse, outbred
mice. The percent variance explained by chromatin state closely matched
that of haplotype, and exceeded that of individual SNPs. These results
suggest two things. First, a large portion of the effect of local
haplotype on gene expression in mice is likely mediated through
variation in chromatin state. Second, the intermediate resolution of
chromatin state between that of individual SNPs and broad haplotypes
carries important imfornation that cannot be resolved at the other
levels. Individual SNPs, although, sometimes causally linked to trait
variation, are highly redundant and cannot be readily used to annotate
functional elements in the genome. Haplotypes aggregate genomic
information over broad regions and are a powerful tool to link genomic
variation to trait variation. However, they are usually too broad to be
used to annotate regions less than a few megabases in length. By
combining the mapping power of haplotypes, the high resolution of SNPs,
and the intermediate resolution of chromatin states, we can begin to
build mechanistic hypotheses that link genetic variation to variation in
physiology. Understanding the role that genetic variation plays in
modifying the chromatin state landscape will be critical in making these
links. Through this survey we are providing one of the first rigorous
resources that explores the connection between genetic variation and
epigenetic variation.

work this paragraph in\ldots{} That states 14 and 13 were associated
with reduced gene expression both within hepatocytes and across strains
suggests that there may be differential epigenetic silencing of genes in
hepatocytes across strains. Further, the majority of chromatin states
were associated with variation in expression across strains, suggesting
that epigenetic regulation of gene expression through histone
modification may contribute substantially to variation in gene
expression across genetically distinct individuals. That most states
have the same effects across genes within a cell type and across strains
suggests that the mechanisms that are used to regulate cell type
specificity also contribure to variation in genetically distinct
individuals.

\caption{Example of epigenetic states and imuptation results for a single 
gene, \textit{Pkd2}. (A) The variance in DO gene expression explained at 
each position along the gene body by each of the imputed genomic 
features: SNPs - red X's, Chromatin State - blue plus signs, and 
Percent Methylation - green circles. The horizontal dashed line shows 
the variance explained by the haplotype. For reference, the arrow 
below this panel runs from the TSS of \textit{Pkd2} to the TES and 
shows the direction of transcription. (B) The chromatin states assigned 
to each 200 bp window in this gene for each inbred mouse strain. States 
are colored by their effect on gene expression in the inbred mice. Red 
indicates a positive effect on gene expression, and blue indicates a 
negative effect. Each row shows the chromatin states for a single inbred 
strain, which is indicated by the label on the left. (C) SNPs along the 
gene body for each inbred strain. The reference genotype is shown in gray. 
SNPs are colored by genotype as shown in the legend. (D) Percent DNA 
methylation for each inbred strain along the \textit{Pkd2} gene body. 
Percentages are binned into 0\% (blue) 50\% (yellow) and 100\% (red). 
(E) Haplotype effects for expression of \textit{Pkd2} in the DO. 
Haplotype effects are colored by from which each allele was derived. 
(F) \textit{Pkd2} expression levels across inbred mouse strains. For 
ease of comparison, all panels B through F are shown in the same order 
as the haplotype effects.}

\caption{Comparison of emissions probabilities across all ChromHMM models.
Each row contains data for a single ChromHMM model fit to the number of
states indicated on either side of the row. Each set of four columns shows
data for each of the four histone modifications. Each set is separated from
the next by a column of gray for ease of visualization. The bottom row, the
reference row, shows the ideal state that all model states are being compared
to. Blue indicates absence of the histone mark and red indicates presence.
For each ChromHMM model, each state was assigned to one of the reference states
using an emissions probability of 0.3 as a threshold for presence of the histone
modification. If a state was not present in the given model, the corresponding
area is shown in gray. Emissions probabilities near 0 are shown in blue, and 
probabilities near 1 are shown in red. Orange and yellow indicate intermediate
probabilities. Aligning the states across all models shows a remarkable 
stability in the emissions across models, seen as vertical bars of consistent 
color.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Comparison of state abundance across all ChromHMM models. The left-most column
shows the annotation for each state. Unannotated states are marked with a dash. The 
binary heatmap indicates which histone modifications were present in each state: 1 
indicates presence, and 0 indicates absence. The histone modifications are labeled
at the bottom of each column. The continuous heatmap shows the abundance of each state
(in rows) in each ChromHMM model (in columns). The abundance is the proportion of 
transcribed genes with the state present. Less abundant states are shaded blue, and 
more abundant states are shaded yellow, orange, and red. The number of states in the
model is indicated at the bottom of each column. The black box highlights the model
used in this study -- the 14-state model. State abundance was remarkably
stable across the different models.}

\caption{Comparison of state effect across all ChromHMM models. This figure is 
identical to Figure \ref{supp_fig:model_abundance_comparison}, except that the
cells in the continuous heatmap show the effect of each state on gene expression
across all ChromHMM models. The effect was the $\beta$ coefficient derived from
a linear model. Similar to state abundance, the effects were remarkably stable
across models.}

\caption{Schematic for imputation of histone modifications into the 
DO mice. For a single transcript imputation was made by multiplying 
a three-dimensional array, containing chromatin state by strain by
position, by a two-dimensional array, contatining haplotype probabilities
by DO individual, to create a three-dimensional array, containing 
individual by position by chromatin state probability.}
