The correlation between chromatin state and gene expression, as well as
positional enrichments around functionally annotated positions in the 
genome aided annotation of individual chromatin states. For example, 
chromatin state 5, which was characterized by the co-occurence of H3K27ac 
and H3K4me1, had enriched representation around known enhancers. 
Its presence was also positively correlated with gene expression. This
combination of chromatin modifications has previously been associated with 
active enhancers [21106759, 21160473, 29273804].

State 7, which was characterized by the presence of three activating
marks, H3k27ac, H3k4me1, and H3K4me3. It was enriched around 
transcription start sites (TSS) and promoters and was also positively 
correlated with gene expression. 

State 3 was characterized by the presence of H3K4me1 and H3k27me3. 
H3K27me3 is associated with downregulation of transcription and
poised enhancers. When paired with H3K4me1

also enriched around 
promoters and TSS, but was most strongly enriched at transcription 
factor binding sites,

### Promoter and enhancer states correlated with increased expression
Chromatin states 5 and 7, which were enriched around enhancers and promoters 
respectively, were correlated with increased expression. This was true
both across the liver transcriptome, as well as across strains. That is,
that within a single strain, genes with higher proportions of states 5 
or 7 across the gene body were more highly expressed than genes with 
low proportions of these states. And for individual genes, strains 
with higher proportions of states 5 and 7 had higher expression than 
strains with lower proportions of these states (Figure?).

State 6 was also correlated with increased gene expression to a lesser
degree. This state was also enriched at enhancers, though less so than 
state 5.

### H3K27me3 and the absence of measured marks correlated with decreased expression

High abundance of states 1, 2, and 3 were correlated with decreased 
gene expression. State 1 was the absence of all measured chromatin 
modifications, and states 2 and 3 were the only states with the 
suppressing modification H3K27me3. State 1 was enriched in intergenic 
regions and state 3 was enriched around transcription factor binding 
sites. Positional enrichment of state 2 was not clear.
