## Introduction

This document holds information that was removed from the methods section
in case we need to put anything back.

## Mouse processing

Mice were aged and processed in groups to maintain a 
steady sample preparation workflow. Mice were housed, born, and aged 
in the same mouse room, with uniformity in timing, diet, and all other
possible conditions. Female mice were used for all experiments due to 
potentially confounding effects from variation in testosterone among 
males that can affect liver gene expression, as well general experience 
that female expression is less variable than male in multiple tissues. 
This will also facilitate the analysis of maternal effects on offspring 
in later studies.
